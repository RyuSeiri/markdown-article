1
00:02:03,807 --> 00:02:07,807
 To summarise: Prudence and Belisaire
 Beresford are married,..

2
00:02:09,327 --> 00:02:11,886
 ..they have one daughter,..

3
00:02:11,887 --> 00:02:14,887
 ..two adorable grandchildren,..

4
00:02:15,127 --> 00:02:18,127
 ..and they will live happily
 ever after.

5
00:02:18,367 --> 00:02:21,367
 Things have not turned out
 the way I expected !

6
00:02:22,407 --> 00:02:25,407
 Very profound, but hardly new.

7
00:02:29,327 --> 00:02:32,327
 I am bored.
 I am so very bored.

8
00:02:33,527 --> 00:02:36,527
 I am in a deep, dark vault.

9
00:02:36,647 --> 00:02:39,647
 You have buried me alive.

10
00:02:39,687 --> 00:02:42,086
 When they open my coffin,..

11
00:02:42,087 --> 00:02:45,087
 ..they will see the scratches
 on the lid..

12
00:02:45,367 --> 00:02:48,246
 where I wore my fingers down
 to stumps..

13
00:02:48,247 --> 00:02:50,766
 ..fighting to get out.
 - What's the matter with you ?

14
00:02:50,767 --> 00:02:53,767
 Oh, nothing !
 Nothing happens, that's all.

15
00:02:54,647 --> 00:02:57,647
 I can't take any more of
 this humdrum existence.

16
00:02:57,687 --> 00:03:00,687
 And I suppose you are
 fully content ?

17
00:03:00,927 --> 00:03:02,766
 Colonel Beresford,..

18
00:03:02,767 --> 00:03:05,767
 ..former head of
 the Secret Service,..

19
00:03:05,847 --> 00:03:08,847
 ..man of mystery,
 of missions impossible...

20
00:03:09,367 --> 00:03:12,006
 Don't you ache anymore
 for excitement ?

21
00:03:12,007 --> 00:03:14,886
 For romantic adventure ?

22
00:03:14,887 --> 00:03:16,726
 Imagine the thrill..

23
00:03:16,727 --> 00:03:20,727
 ..of hearing a knock at the door,
 to go to open it..

24
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:23,287
 ..and see a dead man stagger in !

25
00:03:24,607 --> 00:03:26,726
 If he was dead, he wouldn't
 be staggering.

26
00:03:26,727 --> 00:03:29,727
 But yes, they always stagger
 before they die.

27
00:03:30,447 --> 00:03:33,447
 Then they fall - uttering
 enigmatic words, like :..

28
00:03:34,367 --> 00:03:37,367
 ..''The Spotted Leopard...
 Argh... !''

29
00:03:38,567 --> 00:03:40,966
 I don't think I like dead men
 who stagger about.

30
00:03:40,967 --> 00:03:43,967
 Oh, that'll be Meals on Wheels !

31
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
What are you doing ?

32
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,500
Can you smell something ?

33
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:09,000
< No, nothing.

34
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,500
Can't you smell that odour ?

35
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,500
< An odour - of what ?
- Of... I'm not sure...

36
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:16,500
Of old age.

37
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:19,500
< Old age ?
- Yes, exactly that. Old age.

38
00:04:20,047 --> 00:04:23,600
 Thank you very much.
 -< No - no...

39
00:04:23,727 --> 00:04:26,000
 It isn't you, it's me.

40
00:04:26,087 --> 00:04:30,087
 For some time, I've felt old age
 creeping up on me.

41
00:04:31,527 --> 00:04:33,006
 Me, I feel nothing.

42
00:04:33,007 --> 00:04:36,007
 You feel nothing. One feels nothing.
 -< When you've quite finished..

43
00:04:36,327 --> 00:04:40,327
 ..conjugating the verb "to feel"...
 -< But we're not old !

44
00:04:42,607 --> 00:04:45,326
 Not old ?  Aren't we pensioners ?

45
00:05:03,007 --> 00:05:06,007
 When you retired, it ruined
 my life.

46
00:05:06,327 --> 00:05:10,727
 It was you who wanted a vacation.
 - To take holidays - precisely.

47
00:05:11,207 --> 00:05:14,207
 Anyway,
 don't take any notice of me.

48
00:05:14,687 --> 00:05:16,606
 How are things, George ?

49
00:05:16,607 --> 00:05:19,607
 I'm burning the dead leaves.
 Anything else?

50
00:05:19,687 --> 00:05:21,446
 That's fine.

51
00:05:21,447 --> 00:05:24,947
 I don't believe I've seen
 you like this before.

52
00:05:25,247 --> 00:05:28,247
 It's been churning around
 in my mind for a long time.

53
00:05:28,367 --> 00:05:31,367
 Why not buy a new hat ?
 - I already have lots !

54
00:05:31,767 --> 00:05:34,206
 So what if you have 40,..

55
00:05:34,207 --> 00:05:35,966
 ..another might do the trick.
 Let's go.

56
00:05:35,967 --> 00:05:38,967
 I have 44; and the hats all
 resemble each other.

57
00:05:39,847 --> 00:05:42,847
 Even though there are subtle
 differences between them.

58
00:05:43,527 --> 00:05:46,527
 I would love something
 exciting to happen to us.

59
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:50,126
 It would us both good.

60
00:05:50,127 --> 00:05:52,966
 If only a fairy-godmother
 would appear...

61
00:07:01,967 --> 00:07:04,526
 Conductor...

62
00:07:06,967 --> 00:07:08,166
 What is wrong ?

63
00:07:08,167 --> 00:07:11,167
 A woman was being strangled
 in the train that overtook us.

64
00:07:13,007 --> 00:07:14,446
 I saw it all.

65
00:07:14,447 --> 00:07:17,366
 Tell me calmly exactly
 what you saw.

66
00:07:17,367 --> 00:07:20,086
 I was asleep...

67
00:07:20,087 --> 00:07:22,406
 The other train overtook us...

68
00:07:22,407 --> 00:07:25,407
 And I saw the back of a man
 - strangling a woman.

69
00:07:26,487 --> 00:07:29,487
 Strangling a woman ?
 - Yes.

70
00:07:30,087 --> 00:07:33,087
 Like in the book
 you are reading ?

71
00:07:33,247 --> 00:07:35,326
 Exactly the same !

72
00:07:35,327 --> 00:07:38,126
 Well, then...

73
00:07:38,127 --> 00:07:42,027
 Rudi, did you see anything
 strange on the 4:50 express ?

74
00:07:42,247 --> 00:07:43,446
 No, why ?

75
00:07:43,447 --> 00:07:45,126
 Nothing, forget it.

76
00:07:45,127 --> 00:07:48,127
 I would like to know what
 you intend to do.

77
00:07:48,247 --> 00:07:51,246
 I am not a policeman.
 But, if it will reassure you,..

78
00:07:51,247 --> 00:07:54,206
 ..I will make out
 an incident report.

79
00:07:54,207 --> 00:07:56,086
 An incident ?

80
00:07:56,087 --> 00:07:59,087
 It was a crime !

81
00:08:17,207 --> 00:08:19,486
 Aunt Babette !

82
00:08:19,487 --> 00:08:23,487
 Prudence,
 I have been witness to a crime !

83
00:08:24,367 --> 00:08:27,367
 A crime ?
 - Yes, a crime !

84
00:08:30,727 --> 00:08:32,526
 No, no, not a thing !

85
00:08:32,527 --> 00:08:34,086
 No mention of a corpse.

86
00:08:34,087 --> 00:08:37,086
 You don't believe I invented it ?
 - Of course not !

87
00:08:37,087 --> 00:08:38,446
 You make me feel better.

88
00:08:38,447 --> 00:08:40,886
 That conductor,
 he didn't believe me.

89
00:08:40,887 --> 00:08:43,686
 But I gave him a clear
 statement of what I saw.

90
00:08:43,687 --> 00:08:46,526
 An ordinary attacker
 would have fled..

91
00:08:46,527 --> 00:08:48,606
 ..and left the body.

92
00:08:48,607 --> 00:08:51,607
 So, it was premeditated,
 or a crime of passion...

93
00:08:52,487 --> 00:08:55,487
 Jealousy, anger - and the man
 strangles...

94
00:08:56,927 --> 00:08:59,927
 But I don't see
 what he did with the body.

95
00:09:00,327 --> 00:09:03,327
 Ah ! He threw it from the window.

96
00:09:06,367 --> 00:09:09,367
 He hid it in a suitcase.

97
00:09:09,447 --> 00:09:12,447
 What sort of killer walks around
 with a body in a suitcase ?

98
00:09:13,967 --> 00:09:16,046
 It would be noticed.

99
00:09:16,047 --> 00:09:17,886
 One more, for the road ?

100
00:09:17,887 --> 00:09:20,887
 As far as I'm concerned,
 he threw it from the window.

101
00:09:21,527 --> 00:09:24,527
 < Or the corpse staggered off !

102
00:09:26,647 --> 00:09:28,886
 Your assassin was burly ?
 -< Yes.

103
00:09:28,887 --> 00:09:31,486
 < At least it seemed so to me.

104
00:09:31,487 --> 00:09:34,487
 < Big enough, mainly brown.

105
00:09:34,687 --> 00:09:36,606
 I only saw his back.

106
00:09:38,247 --> 00:09:40,366
 And the unfortunate victim, so.
 Argh !

107
00:09:42,127 --> 00:09:44,286
 She wore red gloves !

108
00:09:44,287 --> 00:09:47,246
 < It... was horrible.
 -< You must have..

109
00:09:47,247 --> 00:09:50,247
 ..dreamt it, or witnessed
 a domestic dispute..

110
00:09:50,327 --> 00:09:53,327
 ..less tragic than you imagined.

111
00:09:53,687 --> 00:09:57,687
 Less tragic ?! It was a crime !
 I saw it with my own eyes.

112
00:09:58,327 --> 00:10:00,926
 < I am disappointed !
 Your Belisaire is..

113
00:10:00,927 --> 00:10:03,927
 ..like the rest of them.
 He doesn't believe me.

114
00:10:04,887 --> 00:10:07,887
 And this happened somewhere
 beyond Andelieux ?

115
00:10:08,287 --> 00:10:09,446
 Yes.

116
00:10:09,447 --> 00:10:12,947
 I remember the place.
 There was a curve..

117
00:10:13,087 --> 00:10:14,806
 ..that rocked me in my seat.

118
00:10:14,807 --> 00:10:17,807
 And our train went through
 the station at Andelieux..

119
00:10:18,207 --> 00:10:21,207
 ..ten minutes later.
 There you are, Belisaire !

120
00:10:21,527 --> 00:10:24,527
 < I shall need absolute
 peace of mind..

121
00:10:24,607 --> 00:10:26,046
 ..during my trip abroad.

122
00:10:26,047 --> 00:10:29,047
 < Where are you going to hunt,
 this time ?  - In Guiana.

123
00:10:29,407 --> 00:10:32,407
 The Zigoeunus Thomasus
 moth. The male.

124
00:10:32,567 --> 00:10:35,567
 It is the most graceful moth
 within the Amazon region...

125
00:10:57,167 --> 00:10:59,366
 < Why are you ironing your kilt ?

126
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:01,526
 For my reunion in Glasgow.

127
00:11:01,527 --> 00:11:04,366
 You know, the Society of
 the Oval Thistle.

128
00:11:04,367 --> 00:11:06,886
 Have you forgotten I'm leaving
 the day after tomorrow ?

129
00:11:06,887 --> 00:11:09,887
 Then you must devote yourself
 to ironing your pleats.

130
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:13,206
 What are you doing ?

131
00:11:13,207 --> 00:11:16,207
 Drop this nonsense of
 Aunt Babette's ''crime'' !

132
00:11:16,527 --> 00:11:19,527
 You've forgotten that
 crime is our business.

133
00:11:20,327 --> 00:11:23,327
 It is obvious that your aunt
 was mistaken.

134
00:11:24,087 --> 00:11:27,086
 Commissioner Richard
 searched everywhere.

135
00:11:27,087 --> 00:11:30,087
 Trains, stations, hospitals,
 morgues. No sign of a body.

136
00:11:30,767 --> 00:11:33,767
 No-one reported missing.

137
00:11:36,847 --> 00:11:38,366
 The train that overtook..

138
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:41,367
 ..Babette's must have been
 the 4:50..

139
00:11:41,687 --> 00:11:43,926
 ..that stops at Aigrefonds.

140
00:11:43,927 --> 00:11:46,646
 Then, the railway track..

141
00:11:46,647 --> 00:11:49,647
 ..follows the county boundary
 for some distance...

142
00:11:50,927 --> 00:11:53,927
 But then,
 there actually is a curve.

143
00:11:54,287 --> 00:11:55,406
 And then ?

144
00:11:55,407 --> 00:11:58,286
 The assassin threw
 the body out the window.

145
00:11:58,287 --> 00:12:00,046
 < Frankly, that's what you
 want to have happened !

146
00:12:00,047 --> 00:12:03,047
 An accomplice,
 hidden in the thicket..

147
00:12:03,367 --> 00:12:06,367
 ..bundles the victim
 into his black van..

148
00:12:06,607 --> 00:12:09,607
 ..and dumps everything
 into the lake.

149
00:12:09,847 --> 00:12:12,166
 There is no lake around there.

150
00:12:12,167 --> 00:12:15,167
 You believe only what you can see,
 my poor man.

151
00:12:15,247 --> 00:12:18,247
 That is why
 you are led astray so often.

152
00:12:31,967 --> 00:12:34,967
 ''I remember the place.
 There was a curve..

153
00:12:35,367 --> 00:12:37,286
 ''..that rocked me in my seat.

154
00:12:37,287 --> 00:12:40,287
 ''And our train went through
 the station at Andelieux.''

155
00:13:01,007 --> 00:13:03,486
 < I believe I've found it.

156
00:13:03,487 --> 00:13:06,487
 Close to the curve, there is
 a queer property, isolated.

157
00:13:07,727 --> 00:13:10,446
 Ideal for disposing of a body.

158
00:13:10,447 --> 00:13:11,766
 This is an obsession.

159
00:13:11,767 --> 00:13:14,686
 I have an intuition that
 Babette was right.

160
00:13:14,687 --> 00:13:16,366
 Don't talk to me about intuition.

161
00:13:16,367 --> 00:13:19,326
 She doesn't have the imagination
 to invent such a story.

162
00:13:19,327 --> 00:13:22,327
 Then perhaps it was a hallucination.

163
00:13:22,407 --> 00:13:24,606
 Aunt Babette is alright in the head.

164
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:27,486
 She is a world authority
 on butterflies.

165
00:13:27,487 --> 00:13:30,487
 She doesn't invent them.
 She catches them, and names them.

166
00:13:31,367 --> 00:13:34,367
 She wants to do the same with
 the killer, and I will help her.

167
00:13:34,887 --> 00:13:37,887
 One doesn't hunt a killer
 like a butterfly.

168
00:13:38,167 --> 00:13:42,167
 No. It's the same. One traps them
 and - shlack - one pins them.

169
00:13:42,847 --> 00:13:45,406
 ''Shlack'' ! I don't understand.

170
00:13:45,407 --> 00:13:48,407
 That's because you don't listen !

171
00:13:51,087 --> 00:13:54,087
 Have a good time with your
 friends of the Oval Thistle.

172
00:13:54,807 --> 00:13:57,807
 We won't be drinking water.
 Have no doubt !

173
00:13:59,767 --> 00:14:02,767
 Bye. Have a safe trip !

174
00:14:25,007 --> 00:14:26,366
 Look at the Scotsman !

175
00:14:26,367 --> 00:14:29,367
 They don't wear anything
 under their kilts, you know.

176
00:14:34,487 --> 00:14:37,487
 How did I manage to do this ?

177
00:14:44,247 --> 00:14:45,846
 Can we help you ?

178
00:15:05,647 --> 00:15:07,046
 Your hat.

179
00:15:50,167 --> 00:15:51,206
 I wonder who..

180
00:15:51,207 --> 00:15:54,207
 ..that girl might be ?
 - She could be the new maid..

181
00:15:55,327 --> 00:15:57,006
 ..up at ''La Vallée aux Loups''.

182
00:15:57,007 --> 00:16:00,007
 None of them last very long.

183
00:16:00,047 --> 00:16:03,047
 < Old Man Charpentier
 sees to that.

184
00:16:05,767 --> 00:16:07,806
 < That poor girl...

185
00:16:07,807 --> 00:16:09,886
 With all the snow out there..

186
00:16:09,887 --> 00:16:12,887
 ..she won't be catching a bus.

187
00:16:18,887 --> 00:16:21,887
 There won't be a bus today.
 Can I take you somewhere ?

188
00:16:27,327 --> 00:16:29,606
 What luck you were there !

189
00:16:29,607 --> 00:16:32,607
 I am sure they would have all
 left me to freeze on the spot.

190
00:16:39,727 --> 00:16:41,486
 Your seats are heated ?

191
00:16:41,487 --> 00:16:43,566
 No-no, it's the motor you feel.

192
00:16:43,567 --> 00:16:46,126
 They are all dogs in that place.

193
00:16:46,127 --> 00:16:48,246
 Like my employer,
 M. Charpentier.

194
00:16:48,247 --> 00:16:49,566
 He's a dog ?
 - A rat !

195
00:16:49,567 --> 00:16:52,567
 Rich beyond belief, but
 you'd never know it, the rat !

196
00:16:53,167 --> 00:16:56,167
 Always in the corridors,
 waiting to stare at me !

197
00:16:57,847 --> 00:17:00,006
 You know, staring...

198
00:17:00,007 --> 00:17:02,646
 Staring, how ?
 I can't tell you.

199
00:17:02,647 --> 00:17:04,326
 He sends shivers down my spine.

200
00:17:04,327 --> 00:17:07,327
 Fact is, Old Man Charpentier
 frightens everyone.

201
00:17:08,567 --> 00:17:10,686
 What do you do in the house
 of this old man ?

202
00:17:10,687 --> 00:17:14,687
 Everything.  Washing-up,
 dusting, shopping, making beds.

203
00:17:15,307 --> 00:17:18,607
 All by yourself ?
 No, there is Mme. Clairin.

204
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:21,446
 But the place is so large,
 it really needs an army.

205
00:17:21,447 --> 00:17:23,366
 Does he live there alone ?

206
00:17:23,367 --> 00:17:26,366
 No, with his poor daughter
 and a gardener.

207
00:17:26,367 --> 00:17:28,086
 The worst thing is the kitchen.

208
00:17:28,087 --> 00:17:31,087
 It's like something
 out of the Middle Ages.

209
00:17:31,767 --> 00:17:33,606
 You've been there a long time ?

210
00:17:33,607 --> 00:17:36,607
 Seven weeks. I don't want to
 stay a moment longer.

211
00:18:54,927 --> 00:18:57,927
 Come in.
 I will fetch Mademoiselle.

212
00:19:04,207 --> 00:19:06,206
 The new domestic is here.

213
00:19:06,207 --> 00:19:09,207
 < Send her into my office.
 - Very well, Mademoiselle.

214
00:19:11,727 --> 00:19:13,806
 Come, she will see you now.

215
00:19:13,807 --> 00:19:16,807
 You are the 13th this year.
 Superstitious ?

216
00:19:42,767 --> 00:19:45,366
 Bonjour,
 I am Emma Charpentier.

217
00:19:45,367 --> 00:19:47,446
 You are a good cook ?

218
00:19:47,447 --> 00:19:50,447
 You have references ?
 No, none.

219
00:19:50,607 --> 00:19:52,286
 That is quite unusual.

220
00:19:52,287 --> 00:19:55,126
 For the most part,
 they are of little value.

221
00:19:55,127 --> 00:19:58,127
 They never say
 why one left a place.

222
00:20:00,287 --> 00:20:04,287
 Very true. What day would you
 prefer as a rest day ?

223
00:20:04,407 --> 00:20:09,407
 I am very flexible. Since
 the death of my dear husband...

224
00:20:10,767 --> 00:20:13,767
 My time is my own.

225
00:20:13,967 --> 00:20:16,967
 Very well.
 Let me show you your room.

226
00:20:23,567 --> 00:20:25,606
 I need more than a kitchen maid.

227
00:20:25,607 --> 00:20:28,607
 Mme. Clairin isn't here every day.

228
00:20:28,767 --> 00:20:31,767
 My grandfather, he built the
 house. A fantastic man.

229
00:20:32,447 --> 00:20:35,447
 But very strict.
 The damage was done by my father..

230
00:20:35,527 --> 00:20:38,686
 ..in a fit of anger. He refuses
 to let anyone repair it.

231
00:20:38,687 --> 00:20:41,687
 My father is a difficult man.

232
00:20:42,247 --> 00:20:45,247
 He keeps a close eye on expenses,
 and can be... difficult.

233
00:20:47,407 --> 00:20:49,126
 - I am used to..

234
00:20:49,127 --> 00:20:51,086
 ..the habits of the elderly.

235
00:20:51,087 --> 00:20:53,726
 To begin with, things will be
 easy. There are four of us.

236
00:20:53,727 --> 00:20:56,646
 Myself, my niece on vacation,
 her schoolfriend, and...

237
00:20:56,647 --> 00:20:57,486
 Emma !

238
00:20:57,587 --> 00:21:01,987
 ..my father. But my brothers
 will be arriving for Christmas.

239
00:21:02,207 --> 00:21:05,207
 Emma !

240
00:21:05,847 --> 00:21:08,847
 These costings for Christmas.
 You wish to bankrupt me ?

241
00:21:09,887 --> 00:21:12,366
 Who is that, over there ?

242
00:21:12,367 --> 00:21:15,367
 The new kitchen maid
 I spoke to you about.

243
00:21:15,887 --> 00:21:18,887
 Come, come !
 Let's see you, come here !

244
00:21:20,487 --> 00:21:24,487
 What is your name, little one ?
 Prudence Beresford.

245
00:21:27,447 --> 00:21:29,126
 She's got good arms.

246
00:21:29,127 --> 00:21:32,127
 Well then...

247
00:21:34,367 --> 00:21:37,367
 Remember two things :
 I abhor waste..

248
00:21:38,607 --> 00:21:41,607
 ..and a squire is
 not necessarily rich.

249
00:21:41,687 --> 00:21:44,687
 I live here because I want to,
 not because I have the means.

250
00:21:46,127 --> 00:21:48,606
 Now go !
 Don't bother me further.

251
00:21:48,607 --> 00:21:53,607
 Don't forget that a good cod
 does as well as a turbot.

252
00:21:55,687 --> 00:21:58,086
 I am sorry.

253
00:21:58,087 --> 00:22:00,046
 Emma !

254
00:22:00,047 --> 00:22:01,766
 Come here, Emma !

255
00:22:01,767 --> 00:22:03,486
 Excuse me.

256
00:22:03,487 --> 00:22:06,487
 I must go. Your room is
 at the top - on the left.

257
00:22:06,767 --> 00:22:08,486
 The key is in the door.

258
00:22:08,487 --> 00:22:11,487
 My own children
 have become my enemies !

259
00:22:14,207 --> 00:22:17,207
 < Tell that idiot of a doctor
 that last medicine..

260
00:22:18,647 --> 00:22:19,806
 < ..is no good at all !

261
00:22:19,807 --> 00:22:22,807
 < Are you sure ?
 -< Of course !

262
00:22:59,367 --> 00:23:02,367
 Who is there ?

263
00:23:25,207 --> 00:23:28,207
 You must be the niece...
 of Mlle. Charpentier.

264
00:23:28,327 --> 00:23:31,327
 Yes, I am Alexie Charpentier.

265
00:23:32,687 --> 00:23:35,687
 And you, you are Mary Poppins !
 - Ah ! Mary Poppins !

266
00:23:36,127 --> 00:23:39,127
 You aren't my idea of a maid
 working for my grandfather.

267
00:23:39,807 --> 00:23:43,807
 You aren't my idea of the niece
 of Mlle. Charpentier.

268
00:23:44,367 --> 00:23:47,367
 Mme. Clairin is waiting for you
 in the kitchen.

269
00:23:47,387 --> 00:23:49,406
 Then let me change,
 and I'll be right there.

270
00:23:49,407 --> 00:23:52,086
 I'll wait for you on the landing.

271
00:23:52,087 --> 00:23:53,006
 Emma !

272
00:23:53,007 --> 00:23:57,007
 Always he shouts after my aunt.
 Yet she's the only one who loves him.

273
00:23:57,727 --> 00:24:00,727
 Don't the others love him ?
 - They are like vultures.

274
00:24:01,327 --> 00:24:03,126
 They are waiting for him to die.

275
00:24:03,127 --> 00:24:05,846
 Who are the vultures ?
 - My uncles.

276
00:24:05,847 --> 00:24:10,847
 Uncle Raphael. He is weird.
 A banker, and a gambler.

277
00:24:11,507 --> 00:24:14,086
 He lives in Lyon, with his wife.

278
00:24:14,087 --> 00:24:17,046
 He likes only money and drugs.

279
00:24:17,047 --> 00:24:19,126
 Uncle Augustin lives
 on an island.

280
00:24:19,127 --> 00:24:22,127
 He has abandoned sculpting
 to spend his time hunting.

281
00:24:23,527 --> 00:24:25,926
 The more he kills,
 the better he likes it.

282
00:24:25,927 --> 00:24:28,846
 And who looks after you ?
 - My father.

283
00:24:28,847 --> 00:24:31,486
 My mother is dead.
 The family consider him..

284
00:24:31,487 --> 00:24:34,046
 ..a failure. They call him
 ''Frederick the layabout''

285
00:24:34,047 --> 00:24:36,966
 But I don't care.
 He is a good guitarist.

286
00:24:36,967 --> 00:24:37,926
 It's through there.

287
00:24:37,927 --> 00:24:40,927
 And there was Uncle Edmond,
 who died in the War.

288
00:24:41,327 --> 00:24:44,327
 We're nearly there, come along.

289
00:24:50,807 --> 00:24:52,886
 She's already had a tipple.

290
00:24:52,887 --> 00:24:54,646
 A little one for the road,..

291
00:24:54,647 --> 00:24:57,647
 ..Mme. Clairin ?
 - Weather as it is, it helps.

292
00:24:58,447 --> 00:25:00,566
 I've been waiting for you.

293
00:25:00,567 --> 00:25:02,846
 I'll show you
 where the things are.

294
00:25:02,847 --> 00:25:04,966
 It won't take a moment.

295
00:25:04,967 --> 00:25:07,967
 In the scullery, there is
 everything you need for lunch.

296
00:25:12,127 --> 00:25:14,566
 The stove is burning well.
 I lit it..

297
00:25:14,567 --> 00:25:17,206
 ..this morning.
 You need to keep it stoked up.

298
00:25:17,207 --> 00:25:19,526
 It can get cold in the house.

299
00:25:19,527 --> 00:25:22,006
 I have made some coffee.

300
00:25:22,007 --> 00:25:24,006
 So, there you are.
 Goodbye !

301
00:25:24,007 --> 00:25:26,326
 Take care, grandfather hates..

302
00:25:26,327 --> 00:25:30,327
 ..getting his meals late.
 Lunch is at noon, Mme. Poppins.

303
00:26:16,327 --> 00:26:20,327
 Come on,
 or we'll be late !

304
00:26:34,027 --> 00:26:36,946
 < Now who's imagining things ?
 -< Papa, you exaggerate.

305
00:26:36,947 --> 00:26:40,526
 < I know what I'm talking about.
 My sickness, two weeks ago,..

306
00:26:40,527 --> 00:26:43,206
 ..your brothers had
 something to do with that.

307
00:26:43,207 --> 00:26:44,806
 What will you suggest next ?

308
00:26:44,807 --> 00:26:47,646
 < It was only indigestion.

309
00:26:47,647 --> 00:26:49,846
 < Now sit back and calm yourself.

310
00:26:49,847 --> 00:26:52,326
 < You talk to me about indigestion !

311
00:26:52,327 --> 00:26:55,327
 Even your precious Dr. Lagarde
 was suspicious.

312
00:26:56,047 --> 00:26:59,047
 But you forget one thing.

313
00:26:59,247 --> 00:27:02,247
 Misers always die last.

314
00:27:09,127 --> 00:27:10,966
 The dumb waiter doesn't work.

315
00:27:10,967 --> 00:27:12,486
 The lead weights have fallen off.

316
00:27:12,487 --> 00:27:15,166
 Can it be repaired ?
 - I don't think so.

317
00:27:15,167 --> 00:27:18,167
 Let us help you. There are
 only 30 seconds to midday.

318
00:27:19,447 --> 00:27:22,447
 Mme. Poppins,
 Valerie, my best friend.

319
00:27:22,527 --> 00:27:25,527
 Enchanted.
 Away you go. I'll follow.

320
00:27:53,967 --> 00:27:56,967
 This is good, the soup.

321
00:27:59,807 --> 00:28:02,807
 It is good,
 really good, the soup.

322
00:28:53,447 --> 00:28:56,447
 ''A sharp curve...''

323
00:28:56,487 --> 00:28:58,886
 Yes ?
 < Prudence Beresford !

324
00:28:58,887 --> 00:29:01,887
 Finally ! Where are you ?

325
00:29:02,207 --> 00:29:04,686
 Figure it out for yourself...

326
00:29:04,687 --> 00:29:05,646
 Where are you ?

327
00:29:05,647 --> 00:29:08,647
 You haven't launched yourself
 into that ridiculous mystery..

328
00:29:09,127 --> 00:29:11,806
 ..of the railway murder ?

329
00:29:11,807 --> 00:29:15,207
 I have discovered a sudden
 passion for snow-shoes.

330
00:29:15,647 --> 00:29:17,526
 I am practising on them.

331
00:29:17,527 --> 00:29:20,527
 < What ?
 - Yes, I've never dared confess,..

332
00:29:21,487 --> 00:29:24,126
 ..but I have long dreamed of...

333
00:29:24,127 --> 00:29:27,127
 ..walking alone in the snow,
 wearing snow-shoes.

334
00:29:28,927 --> 00:29:30,126
 When are you coming back ?

335
00:29:30,127 --> 00:29:32,046
 I'll be back...

336
00:29:32,047 --> 00:29:34,486
 I'll be back...
 I don't know.

337
00:29:34,487 --> 00:29:36,526
 Make it within 5 days,
 it's Christmas !

338
00:29:36,527 --> 00:29:39,527
 Marie-Christine and her family
 will be spending it with us.

339
00:29:40,647 --> 00:29:41,926
 Is it Christmas already ?

340
00:29:41,927 --> 00:29:44,526
 But yes !
 It comes round once a year.

341
00:29:44,527 --> 00:29:47,527
 How could I forget ?

342
00:29:48,327 --> 00:29:52,327
 Christmas, another chance to
 enjoy the grandchildren !

343
00:30:34,687 --> 00:30:37,166
 You are enjoying yourselves.

344
00:30:37,167 --> 00:30:40,167
 We are off to the museum.
 - The museum ?

345
00:30:40,327 --> 00:30:43,327
 The red house, where grandfather
 keeps his treasures.

346
00:30:43,847 --> 00:30:46,526
 It's beyond the rock over there.

347
00:30:46,527 --> 00:30:47,846
 Come on, it's through here !

348
00:31:19,047 --> 00:31:22,047
 This way.

349
00:31:24,047 --> 00:31:27,047
 < Oh ! It's freezing in here !

350
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,000
 Remember to lock up,
 because of the wild boar.

351
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:26,000
 You are not allowed here.
 This is the squire's museum.

352
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,500
 Sit !!

353
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,700
 *This is the answerphone of
 Babette Boutiti.

354
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,200
 *I am hunting butterflies in
 Guiana.

355
00:35:00,207 --> 00:35:02,806
 *Leave your message after
 the ''pop''.

356
00:35:02,807 --> 00:35:03,886
 *Pop !

357
00:35:03,887 --> 00:35:06,887
 Aunt Babette,
 I have just discovered..

358
00:35:07,727 --> 00:35:10,686
 ..the body
 of a strangled woman..

359
00:35:10,687 --> 00:35:13,687
 ..wearing a fur coat, with
  a red glove..

360
00:35:13,847 --> 00:35:16,086
 ..in a large sarcophagus.

361
00:35:16,087 --> 00:35:19,087
 There you are.  I will tell
 you more when you return.

362
00:35:19,487 --> 00:35:22,487
 Good, that's all for now.

363
00:35:40,167 --> 00:35:42,126
 Belisaire !

364
00:35:42,927 --> 00:35:45,406
 Rotten sod !

365
00:35:47,687 --> 00:35:49,606
 Is it still Christmas ?

366
00:36:13,967 --> 00:36:16,967
 I've never seen that woman
 before, I'm certain.

367
00:36:17,487 --> 00:36:20,487
 Are you alright ?
 You look very pale, Emma.

368
00:36:21,687 --> 00:36:23,886
 It will pass.
 I'm okay, thank you.

369
00:36:23,887 --> 00:36:25,966
 There we are.
 Now breathe slowly.

370
00:36:25,967 --> 00:36:27,606
 Thank you for being here,
 Francois.

371
00:36:27,607 --> 00:36:30,086
 Whenever you need me.

372
00:36:30,087 --> 00:36:31,886
 Breathe slowly.

373
00:36:31,887 --> 00:36:33,526
 < Inspector Blache,..

374
00:36:33,527 --> 00:36:36,326
 ..Dr Lagarde.
 - Hello.

375
00:36:36,327 --> 00:36:38,126
 Doctor.

376
00:36:38,127 --> 00:36:40,566
 This is unbelievable !

377
00:36:40,567 --> 00:36:43,567
 The sarcophagus is from
 the 18th dynasty !

378
00:36:44,207 --> 00:36:47,207
 I bought it
 more than 50 years ago !

379
00:36:48,047 --> 00:36:50,046
 Now it's in pieces !

380
00:36:50,047 --> 00:36:54,047
 All because a stupid creature
 decided to be killed inside !

381
00:36:54,607 --> 00:36:56,046
 It is appalling.

382
00:36:58,607 --> 00:37:01,086
 M. Charpentier,
 go back to the chateau.

383
00:37:01,087 --> 00:37:03,766
 Give him a whisky,
 I will meet with you later.

384
00:37:08,047 --> 00:37:10,166
 Many of my elderly patients..

385
00:37:10,167 --> 00:37:13,167
 ..play the invalid
 to oppress their relatives.

386
00:37:14,007 --> 00:37:17,006
 Inspector,
 who discovered the body ?

387
00:37:17,007 --> 00:37:19,366
 The new employee.

388
00:37:19,367 --> 00:37:22,046
 You went to the ''museum''..

389
00:37:22,047 --> 00:37:25,047
 ..and forced the lid off the
 sarcophagus.

390
00:37:25,887 --> 00:37:27,006
 Yes.

391
00:37:27,007 --> 00:37:30,007
 For what reason ?
 - I was looking for a body.

392
00:37:31,407 --> 00:37:34,407
 A body ? So you knew there
 was one there ?

393
00:37:35,687 --> 00:37:38,687
 Yes, of course.
 - Furthermore, I will explain.

394
00:37:40,967 --> 00:37:45,967
 It all started with Aunt Babette
 before she left to hunt butterflies...

395
00:38:10,807 --> 00:38:13,807
 I cannot tell you.
 Stone dead !

396
00:38:14,047 --> 00:38:17,047
 And that made me...

397
00:38:19,547 --> 00:38:24,000
 You expect me to swallow that ?
 - You can check.

398
00:38:24,247 --> 00:38:27,947
 My aunt made a statement to the
 railway authorities in Andelieux.

399
00:38:28,967 --> 00:38:30,806
 Your name, if you please ?

400
00:38:30,907 --> 00:38:33,807
 Mme. Beresford.
 The Widow Beresford.

401
00:38:35,847 --> 00:38:38,847
 Perhaps you are related to
 Colonel Beresford ?

402
00:38:39,407 --> 00:38:42,407
 It is a common name.
 There are plenty in this region.

403
00:38:43,327 --> 00:38:46,327
 Excuse me, I would like to get
 back to work.

404
00:38:47,887 --> 00:38:50,887
 I'm sorry, I should have
 recognised Mme. Beresford.

405
00:38:51,607 --> 00:38:54,566
 But I saw her
 for a very short time.

406
00:38:54,567 --> 00:38:56,366
 She said she was there to
 practise using snow-shoes !

407
00:38:56,367 --> 00:38:58,366
 I'll give her snow-shoes,
 just you see !

408
00:38:58,367 --> 00:39:01,367
 What'd you say ?
 - Nothing. Speaking to myself.

409
00:39:02,207 --> 00:39:06,707
 She must stop this farce !
 - She could be of help to us.

410
00:39:07,567 --> 00:39:12,567
 If you accompany me, you'll
 have to use another name.

411
00:39:13,087 --> 00:39:14,846
 And why ?

412
00:39:14,947 --> 00:39:16,447
 To protect her.
 There has been a murder there.

413
00:39:16,807 --> 00:39:18,806
 And I forgot to tell you...

414
00:39:19,207 --> 00:39:21,566
 Mme. Prudence is passing
 herself off as a widow.

415
00:39:22,887 --> 00:39:25,087
 Mme. Prudence, a widow ?!

416
00:39:25,767 --> 00:39:29,367
 Ha-ha-ha !
 Fancy her thinking of that one !

417
00:39:30,047 --> 00:39:32,766
 Enough.
 I suggest we talk indoors.

418
00:39:33,267 --> 00:39:36,267
 The death happened when ?
 - Pathologist says 2 weeks ago.

419
00:39:36,367 --> 00:39:39,367
 But, according to your aunt,
 she was killed on 28 November..

420
00:39:40,047 --> 00:39:44,447
 ..on the Morgan-Bellefond
 express train.

421
00:39:45,007 --> 00:39:48,807
 Then the corpse was dragged to
 and hidden in the sarcophagus.

422
00:39:49,007 --> 00:39:52,007
 But what led the killer
 to open the sarcophagus ?

423
00:39:53,447 --> 00:39:55,486
 ''You believe only what
 you see.''

424
00:39:55,487 --> 00:39:58,006
 ''That is why you are
 led astray so often.''

425
00:39:58,007 --> 00:40:00,046
 ''Use your imagination.''

426
00:40:00,047 --> 00:40:03,047
 There is no evidence any of
 the Charpentiers are involved.

427
00:40:04,407 --> 00:40:08,407
 "Except that I found the body
 on their property.''

428
00:40:11,927 --> 00:40:13,326
 < Colonel ?

429
00:40:13,327 --> 00:40:16,327
 Colonel, Colonel...
 - Yes... as I was saying...

430
00:40:18,487 --> 00:40:21,487
 I was listening to you.
 What do you know about them ?

431
00:40:22,047 --> 00:40:27,047
 You will meet them. They are
 all at the chateau...

432
00:40:35,067 --> 00:40:38,367
 A lovers' quarrel turned out
 badly. And there you are !

433
00:40:39,007 --> 00:40:41,446
 I will speak to
 Inspector Blavache.

434
00:40:42,047 --> 00:40:43,000
 - Blache,
 Monsieur.

435
00:40:43,687 --> 00:40:46,687
 I will tell Blavache none of
 us have ever seen this woman.

436
00:40:47,087 --> 00:40:49,366
 And you will all say the same.

437
00:40:49,367 --> 00:40:51,086
 Are you sure, father ?

438
00:40:51,087 --> 00:40:54,087
 Perhaps she was one of Raphael's
 little friends.

439
00:40:56,487 --> 00:40:59,487
 That's some joke, that is !

440
00:41:03,887 --> 00:41:06,887
 That must be Dr Lagarde.
 Let him in.

441
00:41:09,607 --> 00:41:12,607
 Still looking for
 the fountain of youth, father ?

442
00:41:15,007 --> 00:41:17,246
 That isn't funny, Augustin.

443
00:41:17,247 --> 00:41:19,366
 Lean on me, father.

444
00:41:19,367 --> 00:41:22,206
 I will outlast all of you..

445
00:41:22,207 --> 00:41:25,207
 ..just to protect my property
 from your predatory grasp.

446
00:41:30,667 --> 00:41:31,926
 The police..

447
00:41:31,927 --> 00:41:34,766
 ..will soon be here
 to interrogate you.

448
00:41:34,767 --> 00:41:37,767
 You'd better prepare
 your alibis !

449
00:41:45,607 --> 00:41:48,607
 Why did you open
 the sarcophagus ?

450
00:41:49,527 --> 00:41:52,527
 I saw the cover
 had been lifted recently.

451
00:41:52,607 --> 00:41:54,926
 I was overcome with curiosity.

452
00:41:54,927 --> 00:41:57,927
 I have always been
 a frustrated archaeologist.

453
00:41:58,767 --> 00:42:00,966
 What more can you tell us ?

454
00:42:00,967 --> 00:42:04,967
 I was, how shall I say,...
 overcome by the smell.

455
00:42:05,327 --> 00:42:08,327
 That sickly smell of death.

456
00:42:08,407 --> 00:42:11,407
 That's all. I don't wish
 to go into details.

457
00:42:13,927 --> 00:42:17,927
 Isn't it horrifying ?! That
 poor woman coming here to die.

458
00:42:18,487 --> 00:42:21,086
 < Forget it.
 We didn't know her.

459
00:42:21,087 --> 00:42:24,087
 She came here by chance.
 - How do you know ?

460
00:42:24,687 --> 00:42:27,086
 If it really was by chance,
 why is Emma..

461
00:42:27,087 --> 00:42:29,766
 ..so troubled ?
 -< Why are you surprised..

462
00:42:29,767 --> 00:42:31,686
 ..that a murder should
 trouble her ?

463
00:42:31,687 --> 00:42:33,406
 He thinks like an artist.

464
00:42:33,407 --> 00:42:36,407
 Why do you always prod people
 as if they were animals ?

465
00:42:39,807 --> 00:42:41,206
 That is enough !

466
00:42:41,207 --> 00:42:42,846
 This is not the time
 for bickering!

467
00:42:42,847 --> 00:42:45,847
 < The police believe the crime
 took place on 28 November.

468
00:42:47,047 --> 00:42:50,047
 < How did they learn that so fast ?
 -< It's not the 19th Century.

469
00:42:51,927 --> 00:42:53,726
 < That's not much to brag about.

470
00:42:53,727 --> 00:42:56,727
 < Friday the 28th. It was the
 day Emma invited us here.

471
00:42:57,367 --> 00:43:00,367
 < So what ?
 -< By that night, we were all here.

472
00:43:01,127 --> 00:43:03,766
 < And ?
 -< It will interest the police.

473
00:43:03,767 --> 00:43:05,846
 < What about the theory
 of a lovers' quarrel ?

474
00:43:05,847 --> 00:43:08,847
 < Not the 1st time Papa's museum
 was used as a meeting place.

475
00:43:09,207 --> 00:43:12,207
 < Lovers meeting in Papa's
 museum ?!

476
00:43:12,527 --> 00:43:15,527
 I have a problem imagining that..

477
00:43:15,727 --> 00:43:18,727
 ..it's like the inside of a
 glacier during Winter.

478
00:43:24,927 --> 00:43:26,726
 Your daughter is lovely.

479
00:43:26,727 --> 00:43:29,727
 She, and her friend, are
 are excited by this crime.

480
00:43:29,847 --> 00:43:31,846
 It's their age.

481
00:43:31,847 --> 00:43:34,847
 Papa, the Inspector is here
 with another gentleman.

482
00:43:36,927 --> 00:43:39,927
 Our new employee, Mme. Beresford,
 recently arrived.

483
00:43:41,447 --> 00:43:44,086
 The Widow Beresford, I presume ?

484
00:43:48,407 --> 00:43:51,086
 Pardon me,
 I have a terrible cold.

485
00:43:51,087 --> 00:43:53,966
 We need you to attend the
 police station.

486
00:43:55,407 --> 00:44:02,407
 One of my officers will accompany
 you, if you are well enough.

487
00:44:02,527 --> 00:44:05,727
 Ask for me, my name is
 ''Colonel Snowshoe'' !

488
00:44:05,807 --> 00:44:07,886
 Good, we would first like..

489
00:44:07,887 --> 00:44:09,486
 ..to interrogate your brothers.

490
00:44:09,487 --> 00:44:11,086
 You are wasting your time,
 Inspector.

491
00:44:11,087 --> 00:44:14,087
 If that woman had ever stayed
 here, my father or I..

492
00:44:15,567 --> 00:44:17,006
 ..would have recognised her.

493
00:44:17,007 --> 00:44:20,007
 < Everything seems to suggest..

494
00:44:20,887 --> 00:44:23,887
 <..that the victim was not
 from around here.

495
00:44:24,007 --> 00:44:27,007
 < She was a stranger.
 - A Russian ?

496
00:44:27,527 --> 00:44:30,527
 < Girls, this is not a
 conversation for your ears.

497
00:44:31,287 --> 00:44:34,287
 Mme. Beresford, conduct the
 gentlemen upstairs.

498
00:44:35,727 --> 00:44:37,606
 Very well.

499
00:44:37,607 --> 00:44:39,686
 I am going to see my father.

500
00:44:39,687 --> 00:44:42,687
 Gentlemen,
 I will show the way.

501
00:44:48,367 --> 00:44:50,726
 So, I am dead, am I?

502
00:44:53,807 --> 00:44:55,966
 Francois !

503
00:44:55,967 --> 00:45:02,467
 Your father is in good form.
 The murder has envigorated him.

504
00:45:14,767 --> 00:45:17,767
 What is it, Emma ?

505
00:45:19,647 --> 00:45:21,286
 What is wrong ?

506
00:45:21,287 --> 00:45:24,046
 I think there is a criminal
 in the family.

507
00:45:24,047 --> 00:45:26,846
 Why do you think that ?

508
00:45:26,847 --> 00:45:29,126
 Because of Martina,..

509
00:45:29,127 --> 00:45:32,127
 ..my brother Edmond's wife,
 who was meant to come here.

510
00:45:32,807 --> 00:45:35,807
 Ah yes, is there any news ?
 - No, that's just it.

511
00:45:36,407 --> 00:45:39,407
 The police think that the
 victim comes from the East.

512
00:45:40,007 --> 00:45:43,007
 And you think the dead woman
 might be Martina ? - Yes.

513
00:45:43,407 --> 00:45:46,407
 I am frightened of telling
 the police about this.

514
00:45:49,327 --> 00:45:54,327
 Have you spoken to your brothers ?
 No, I can't judge their reaction.

515
00:45:56,167 --> 00:45:58,326
 Emma,
 I know you.

516
00:45:58,327 --> 00:46:02,000
 If you don't speak of your fears,
 you will make yourself sick.

517
00:46:02,007 --> 00:46:05,007
 Then I should go to the police ?
 - Yes.

518
00:46:06,687 --> 00:46:08,687
 Gentlemen,
 this way.

519
00:46:08,807 --> 00:46:10,206
 May I take your coat ?

520
00:46:10,207 --> 00:46:12,326
 Never during an enquiry.

521
00:46:12,327 --> 00:46:14,846
 Thank you, madam.
 - I shall stay.

522
00:46:14,850 --> 00:46:17,847
 You will leave,
 madam.

523
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:19,166
 You stinker !

524
00:46:19,167 --> 00:46:22,086
 Without me, you are nothing.

525
00:46:22,547 --> 00:46:25,047
 Nothing ! Nothing at all !

526
00:46:34,527 --> 00:46:38,527
 A moment, let me think.
 When did you arrive ?

527
00:46:39,887 --> 00:46:42,887
 A little over three weeks ago
 to see my father.

528
00:46:44,747 --> 00:46:47,247
 You live away from here ?
 - Yes, I spend my time in Paris.

529
00:46:47,927 --> 00:46:50,927
 I stayed here for two days,
 at the end of November.

530
00:46:53,327 --> 00:46:57,327
 < She was killed, when ?
 -< End of November.

531
00:47:00,687 --> 00:47:02,786
 You are married ?
 Your wife..

532
00:47:02,787 --> 00:47:04,786
 ..is not here with you ?

533
00:47:05,687 --> 00:47:07,000
 She hates Winter in France.

534
00:47:07,027 --> 00:47:08,046
 < Do you come here often ?

535
00:47:08,647 --> 00:47:10,466
 < From time to time,
 to see my sister.

536
00:47:10,767 --> 00:47:14,567
 The last time, when was that ?
 - Three weeks ago.

537
00:47:14,627 --> 00:47:16,646
 The end of November ?

538
00:47:16,847 --> 00:47:18,847
 Yes, end of November.

539
00:47:20,007 --> 00:47:22,507
 How do you get on with
 your father ?

540
00:47:22,967 --> 00:47:26,267
 None of his children get on
 with my father.

541
00:47:26,867 --> 00:47:29,867
 Even Emma has problems.
 He is such a skinflint.

542
00:47:29,947 --> 00:47:32,647
 It was my grandfather's fault.

543
00:47:35,047 --> 00:47:36,726
 Why ?

544
00:47:37,327 --> 00:47:39,927
 He hated Papa, and took his
 revenge in his Will.

545
00:47:40,367 --> 00:47:43,367
 Emma, my brothers and I share
 ownership of the fortune.

546
00:47:43,567 --> 00:47:46,286
 He only retains the right
 to live here.

547
00:47:46,287 --> 00:47:50,287
 He cannot sell anything, decide
 anything, and it drives him crazy !

548
00:47:52,067 --> 00:47:55,867
 You come here often ?
 - Sometimes, with my daughter.

549
00:47:55,887 --> 00:47:59,887
 < Why were you all gathered
 here at the end of November ?

550
00:48:00,127 --> 00:48:02,827
 No reason. It was just
 a family get-together.

551
00:48:04,007 --> 00:48:05,507
 Where everyone hates each other...

552
00:48:06,867 --> 00:48:10,367
 Police enter my house without
 asking the head of family !

553
00:48:12,247 --> 00:48:13,606
 Who is the head here ?

554
00:48:15,007 --> 00:48:16,000
 < Answer me !

555
00:48:16,027 --> 00:48:18,286
 < Answer me !

556
00:48:20,247 --> 00:48:22,447
 < You are, but we wanted
 to avoid tiring you.

557
00:48:23,207 --> 00:48:24,926
 Dr Lagarde..

558
00:48:24,927 --> 00:48:26,206
 ..said...
 - Him. If I listened to him,..

559
00:48:26,207 --> 00:48:28,126
 ..I would never get out of bed.

560
00:48:29,127 --> 00:48:34,127
 The prescription he signed,
 gave me indigestion for 3 weeks !

561
00:48:34,247 --> 00:48:36,406
 He almost..

562
00:48:36,407 --> 00:48:37,966
 ..poisoned me !

563
00:48:37,967 --> 00:48:40,967
 I must admit that was when
 we still had the old cook.

564
00:48:41,487 --> 00:48:44,487
 This new one, here now,
 she is a pearl !

565
00:48:44,967 --> 00:48:48,967
 Well rounded.. like an eclair !

566
00:48:49,047 --> 00:48:52,047
 < Rounded like an eclair ?
 - Ssh !

567
00:48:52,167 --> 00:48:55,867
 Haven't you noticed ?
 - I haven't got that near.

568
00:48:56,207 --> 00:48:57,206
 Well, then...

569
00:48:57,207 --> 00:48:59,406
 What are your assumptions
 about this case ?

570
00:48:59,407 --> 00:49:02,407
 It's a little early to talk
 about assumptions,..

571
00:49:02,927 --> 00:49:05,927
 ..especially since we don't
 yet know who the woman was.

572
00:49:06,247 --> 00:49:09,247
 A stranger, it seems.

573
00:49:10,887 --> 00:49:13,866
 Perhaps a conquest of my son,
 Augustin.

574
00:49:14,067 --> 00:49:15,526
 He says he didn't
 recognise her.

575
00:49:15,627 --> 00:49:18,126
 That means nothing.
 It's got him jittery.

576
00:49:18,127 --> 00:49:21,127
 My sons are all cowards,
 and liars,..

577
00:49:21,927 --> 00:49:24,927
 ..a bunch of vultures who are
 waiting for my death.

578
00:49:26,967 --> 00:49:29,967
 I'm starting to feel very ill.
 Emma !

579
00:49:30,007 --> 00:49:32,006
 I must have a lie-down.

580
00:49:36,967 --> 00:49:39,467
 He doesn't feel much love
 for his children !

581
00:49:40,767 --> 00:49:44,367
 He hasn't forgiven them
 for disinheriting him.

582
00:49:45,687 --> 00:49:48,687
 Au revoir, Colonel.

583
00:50:00,007 --> 00:50:01,607
 What is that ?

584
00:50:26,087 --> 00:50:29,587
 Belisaire,
 don't be an idiot !

585
00:50:29,687 --> 00:50:31,486
 I didn't see anything !

586
00:50:32,887 --> 00:50:34,206
 Come on, open the boot !

587
00:50:34,407 --> 00:50:37,407
 I am dead. A dead man can't
 open boots for his widow.

588
00:50:38,007 --> 00:50:40,566
 I said it on the spur of
 the moment, I was joking.

589
00:50:41,167 --> 00:50:43,567
 The fact you said it makes
 it other than a joke.

590
00:50:43,927 --> 00:50:46,427
 Alright, I said it. Now
 open the boot ! Belisaire !

591
00:50:48,227 --> 00:50:50,827
 The soon-to-be widower
 Belisaire !

592
00:50:51,747 --> 00:50:55,247
 Come on !
 Oh, this can't be happening !

593
00:50:56,007 --> 00:50:57,126
 Belisaire...

594
00:50:57,127 --> 00:51:00,127
 You are offended because I was
 right. It's as simple as that.

595
00:51:06,487 --> 00:51:09,487
 Belisaire, enough is enough,
 let me out.

596
00:51:15,087 --> 00:51:16,766
 Let me out !

597
00:51:18,807 --> 00:51:19,946
 What has happened ?

598
00:51:20,247 --> 00:51:23,447
 The Spotted Leopard !

599
00:51:23,887 --> 00:51:24,866
 Belisaire ?

600
00:51:26,367 --> 00:51:28,367
 You found the body,
 and completed your mission.

601
00:51:28,767 --> 00:51:30,766
 Now, you can return home.

602
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:32,726
 Why ?

603
00:51:32,727 --> 00:51:35,000
 I'm tired of seeing my wife
 disguised as a kitchen maid !

604
00:51:35,167 --> 00:51:36,926
 As to your other activities,
 I hold my tongue.

605
00:51:36,927 --> 00:51:39,927
 Always cooking for others,
 but never for me.

606
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:44,300
 You forget my chicken in salt.
 - That was ten years ago.

607
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:49,500
 And, most important, I must
 repeat - Christmas is here..

608
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:53,900
 The children want to hear the
 chiming of the bells.

609
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:55,900
 Comes from their Swiss side,
 without a doubt.

610
00:51:56,100 --> 00:51:58,700
 I'd like to take a look at
 the autopsy photos.

611
00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:03,100
 This is a dancer.
 - Pardon ?

612
00:52:03,250 --> 00:52:05,750
 The victim was a dancer.
 Look at her feet.

613
00:52:06,100 --> 00:52:10,000
 See if any dancers recognise
 her, but not classical.

614
00:52:10,250 --> 00:52:12,500
 Why not classical ?

615
00:52:12,750 --> 00:52:15,600
 A classical dancer's feet
 would show more punishment.

616
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:19,300
 Impressive, Holmes.
 - Elementary, my dear Watson.

617
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,700
 Now, there is no question of
 me being taken off the case.

618
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:26,700
 Nor away from the fancy men
 who gather round you.

619
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:29,500
 Oh ! You are jealous ?

620
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:33,000
 I think that's sweet !

621
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,750
 Well, now,
 my dear Colonel Beresford,...

622
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:41,000
 ..while this was delightful,
 I must return to my kitchen.

623
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
 You forget one thing :..

624
00:52:46,450 --> 00:52:50,000
 having found the body puts
 you in a difficult position.

625
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:54,250
 You are my number one suspect.
 I must hold you in custody.

626
00:52:56,200 --> 00:52:58,750
 I will notify your employer.

627
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:00,750
 In custody - throughout
 the night ?

628
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:03,700
 Yes. But not in a police cell.

629
00:53:04,100 --> 00:53:08,100
 You always yield to temptation !

630
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,500
 Especially when driven by envy.

631
00:53:56,200 --> 00:53:57,800
 Ah, there you are.

632
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:01,400
 You free from police custody ?
 How was it ?

633
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:06,200
 It was fine. But I never
 thought I'd be held like that.

634
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,300
 What is this place ?
 - My old workshop.

635
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,500
 Nothing has been finished
 here for two years.

636
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
 You abandoned it
 just on a whim ?

637
00:54:35,300 --> 00:54:38,500
 No. I felt the need to see
 some Mediterranean light.

638
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,750
 You will wait for me ?

639
00:54:46,367 --> 00:54:49,367
 What is it this time ?

640
00:54:56,327 --> 00:54:59,327
 < I must talk with you.
 -< Have you heard anything ?

641
00:54:59,807 --> 00:55:02,807
 < I think that the victim
 might be Martina.

642
00:55:03,927 --> 00:55:06,927
 Martina ?
 - Her telegram was so weird.

643
00:55:07,407 --> 00:55:09,966
 After she'd already written
 that she was coming.

644
00:55:10,067 --> 00:55:13,367
 I should tell the police.
 - It's nothing to do with them.

645
00:55:15,287 --> 00:55:17,887
 < I am worried.
 I don't know what to do.

646
00:55:18,007 --> 00:55:21,007
 Just say nothing. Do nothing.

647
00:55:30,367 --> 00:55:32,367
 I was told you have a fondness
 for painting women.

648
00:55:32,927 --> 00:55:36,927
 No. I don't paint women,
 I acquire them.

649
00:55:38,367 --> 00:55:42,367
 It is the sea I paint.
 The stones, the light.

650
00:55:44,047 --> 00:55:45,747
 But not people.
 - No, not people.

651
00:55:47,447 --> 00:55:49,847
 They are too complicated.
 - Mm...

652
00:55:51,687 --> 00:55:54,687
 I don't understand why
 a woman like you is here.

653
00:55:55,447 --> 00:55:57,406
 What do you want me to say ?

654
00:55:57,407 --> 00:55:59,526
 Say nothing at all.

655
00:55:59,527 --> 00:56:01,246
 So many prejudices,
 for an artist !

656
00:56:01,247 --> 00:56:04,247
 Do you like making beds,
 working in the kitchen ?

657
00:56:05,087 --> 00:56:07,887
 Well enough. Cooking
 requires imagination..

658
00:56:07,888 --> 00:56:11,287
 ..and the rest of it satisfies
 my taste for order.

659
00:56:13,047 --> 00:56:16,047
 I would like to paint
 your portrait, one day.

660
00:56:22,227 --> 00:56:26,706
 There she is ! A spy !
 Grab her !

661
00:56:26,767 --> 00:56:28,767
 A SPY !

662
00:56:28,807 --> 00:56:31,726
 Tie her to the pole !
 Dirty spy ! Quickly !

663
00:56:32,407 --> 00:56:35,407
 SPY !

664
00:56:56,127 --> 00:56:58,127
 Aim for the heart !

665
00:56:58,727 --> 00:57:01,526
 Die ! Die, you bitch !

666
00:57:02,567 --> 00:57:03,726
 Aim !

667
00:57:05,727 --> 00:57:07,446
 Fire !

668
00:57:25,447 --> 00:57:27,447
 Thank you for coming.

669
00:57:31,807 --> 00:57:34,726
 Excuse me, I am moved...

670
00:57:34,727 --> 00:57:38,727
 because I haven't entered here
 since the death of Edmond.

671
00:57:40,927 --> 00:57:44,927
 He wrote to me,
 just before his death.

672
00:57:45,007 --> 00:57:48,407
 He had met a Russian woman,
 Martina. They were getting married.

673
00:57:49,807 --> 00:57:54,807
 I learnt of his death just
 after receiving the letter.

674
00:57:54,887 --> 00:57:57,766
 I didn't know what became
 of this Martina.

675
00:57:57,767 --> 00:58:00,767
 I only knew her first name,
 and I forgot about her.

676
00:58:02,527 --> 00:58:05,527
 But, a few weeks ago, I
 received a letter from Lyon..

677
00:58:06,847 --> 00:58:09,847
 ..signed Martina Charpentier.

678
00:58:12,447 --> 00:58:15,847
 ''... I hope this letter does
 not distress you.

679
00:58:16,447 --> 00:58:19,447
 ''I don't even know if Edmond
 told you of our marriage.

680
00:58:20,287 --> 00:58:23,287
 ''After his death, I found it
 too hard to write to you.

681
00:58:23,927 --> 00:58:26,927
 ''I have rebuilt my life, but
 my situation has changed.

682
00:58:27,807 --> 00:58:30,807
 ''I am writing to you
 because of my son.

683
00:58:31,047 --> 00:58:36,347
 ''He is your brother's child.
 I don't have the means to raise him.

684
00:58:36,567 --> 00:58:39,406
 ''I am spending a few weeks
 in France.

685
00:58:39,407 --> 00:58:42,407
 ''May we meet up ? I don't
 want to cause you pain.''

686
00:58:44,047 --> 00:58:46,926
 I loved Edmond very much.

687
00:58:46,927 --> 00:58:51,927
 He was my favourite brother.
 Then, the idea he had a son...

688
00:58:52,287 --> 00:58:55,287
 I invited this woman to our
 house, for the end of November.

689
00:58:55,727 --> 00:58:58,727
 So she could meet the family ?
 - Yes, that's right.

690
00:58:59,167 --> 00:59:01,846
 I just wanted them all
 to meet her.

691
00:59:01,847 --> 00:59:04,847
 Augustin didn't take
 the matter seriously.

692
00:59:05,287 --> 00:59:07,286
 Raphael was very sceptical.

693
00:59:07,287 --> 00:59:10,287
 Frederick was the only one
 to believe it, with me.

694
00:59:10,527 --> 00:59:12,806
 Then what happened ?

695
00:59:15,007 --> 00:59:17,807
 The day when she was expected,
 I received a telegram.

696
00:59:18,007 --> 00:59:20,607
 ''Sorry. Problems.
 Have to leave...''

697
00:59:20,767 --> 00:59:22,726
 And then, nothing more.

698
00:59:22,727 --> 00:59:25,727
 So, when you told me
 this woman..

699
00:59:25,967 --> 00:59:28,926
 ..was foreign, I thought..

700
00:59:28,927 --> 00:59:31,126
 ..that perhaps it was her.

701
00:59:31,127 --> 00:59:33,046
 And, since then, the thought
 has obsessed me.

702
00:59:34,047 --> 00:59:35,946
 With regard to strangers,..

703
00:59:35,947 --> 00:59:38,647
 ..what do you make of this
 Mme. Beresford ?

704
00:59:39,207 --> 00:59:40,886
 Prudence ?

705
00:59:40,888 --> 00:59:43,887
 I've not given her any thought,
 have you ?

706
00:59:44,927 --> 00:59:49,927
 < She is an efficient woman
 and certainly highly intelligent.

707
00:59:49,947 --> 00:59:51,446
 And your brothers ?

708
00:59:51,448 --> 00:59:53,886
 Your father ?

709
00:59:54,090 --> 00:59:58,087
 They are all of one mind.
 She has bewitched them all.

710
00:59:58,207 --> 01:00:01,007
 My God, I will strangle her !
 - Pardon me ?

711
01:00:02,607 --> 01:00:04,607
 < Oh, nothing. Don't torment
 yourself. We will soon..

712
01:00:04,608 --> 01:00:07,287
 ..clear this matter up.
 You were right to talk to me.

713
01:00:16,527 --> 01:00:18,846
 What are you going to do ?

714
01:00:18,847 --> 01:00:20,606
 Check the whereabouts of
 the three brothers..

715
01:00:20,707 --> 01:00:23,807
 ..and go through the entire
 house with a fine tooth comb.

716
01:00:25,087 --> 01:00:27,887
 I have an idea that
 she might be a dancer...

717
01:00:28,007 --> 01:00:29,886
 It was my idea, Belisaire !

718
01:00:29,887 --> 01:00:33,287
 To be fair, Prudence had the
 idea of asking among dancers..

719
01:00:33,387 --> 01:00:36,206
 ..to find the solution.

720
01:00:36,307 --> 01:00:39,566
 Distribute photos of the victim.

721
01:00:59,807 --> 01:01:04,807
 Hop it ! You've no right here.
 Out !

722
01:01:12,447 --> 01:01:15,446
 Lieut. Margaret Brown !

723
01:01:17,007 --> 01:01:20,007
 From the intelligence
 service to here !

724
01:01:28,087 --> 01:01:30,487
 This could be anyone.

725
01:01:32,087 --> 01:01:35,887
 One of your dancers hasn't
 suddenly disappeared ?

726
01:01:38,247 --> 01:01:41,247
 Colonel, the girls here come
 and go like the wind.

727
01:01:42,287 --> 01:01:47,287
 Did one of them leave...
 around the end of November ?

728
01:01:47,587 --> 01:01:51,287
 Anna Karenine.
 - A Russian ?

729
01:01:51,527 --> 01:01:54,527
 Yes, maybe Polish.
 Here, it's the Foreign Legion.

730
01:01:57,407 --> 01:01:59,786
 Anna Karenine. She left here
 at the end of November.

731
01:02:01,247 --> 01:02:04,247
 She said she wanted to be
 reconciled with her husband.

732
01:02:04,447 --> 01:02:06,986
 She went to meet with him
 somewhere in the country.

733
01:02:07,287 --> 01:02:10,287
 She worked with you,
 how long ?

734
01:02:11,247 --> 01:02:14,247
 Six weeks, almost.
 Just an ordinary girl.

735
01:02:14,747 --> 01:02:17,206
 She said she was going on a
 cruise with an Englishman.

736
01:02:17,207 --> 01:02:19,926
 In any event,
 it was just a story.

737
01:02:19,927 --> 01:02:22,886
 I think she was Polish.

738
01:02:22,890 --> 01:02:24,887
 And Catholic :
 she never missed Mass.

739
01:02:24,888 --> 01:02:26,806
 That's a point.

740
01:02:26,807 --> 01:02:28,566
 Only the Polish still believe.

741
01:02:28,567 --> 01:02:30,526
 She was still a liar.

742
01:02:30,527 --> 01:02:31,946
 I don't agree.

743
01:02:38,687 --> 01:02:41,687
 The policemen from the other
 day want to interrogate you.

744
01:02:41,767 --> 01:02:42,996
 Pardon ?

745
01:02:43,527 --> 01:02:45,966
 THEY WANT TO INTERROGATE YOU !

746
01:02:47,527 --> 01:02:48,666
 Please excuse me.

747
01:02:48,767 --> 01:02:50,867
 Your orange juice is
 in the kitchen.

748
01:02:53,007 --> 01:02:55,526
 Where did you get Mme. Beresford ?
 From an agency ?

749
01:02:55,527 --> 01:02:58,527
 No. A friend of a former maid
 told her..

750
01:02:58,807 --> 01:03:01,646
 ..that we had a place free.
 -< So, you engaged..

751
01:03:01,647 --> 01:03:03,926
 ..a stranger who barely arrived..

752
01:03:03,927 --> 01:03:06,646
 ..before digging up a corpse !

753
01:03:06,647 --> 01:03:09,647
 Why don't you stop picking
 on your sister ?

754
01:03:10,527 --> 01:03:13,166
 < Look here, medical man,
 you've got a fine cheek..

755
01:03:13,167 --> 01:03:16,167
 ..you're the one who told
 Emma to talk to the police.

756
01:03:18,927 --> 01:03:22,127
 Don't be so insulting.
 - Now the police are holding us.

757
01:03:22,147 --> 01:03:25,047
 < They think we are responsible
 for Martina's disappearance.

758
01:03:26,127 --> 01:03:27,806
 < If she is the dead woman...

759
01:03:27,807 --> 01:03:29,526
 I'm going to see your father.

760
01:03:29,527 --> 01:03:33,827
 The cake was delicious.
 - Mme. Beresford baked it.

761
01:03:34,207 --> 01:03:37,207
 The number of recipes
 I have remembered !

762
01:03:37,767 --> 01:03:40,486
 It's like skiing,
 one never forgets.

763
01:03:40,487 --> 01:03:42,726
 I doubt this will help to
 advance the investigation.

764
01:03:43,327 --> 01:03:46,327
 But you have forgotten
 one fundamental thing.

765
01:03:47,767 --> 01:03:50,766
 Oh yes ? What's that ?
 - My birthday.

766
01:03:50,767 --> 01:03:54,767
 I don't know what to think.
 It's the 1st time you've forgotten.

767
01:03:54,847 --> 01:03:56,826
 Is it the 22nd ?

768
01:03:56,827 --> 01:03:59,327
 The 22nd of December, the
 birth of Belisaire Beresford.

769
01:03:59,927 --> 01:04:02,927
 Oh sweet Jesus !

770
01:04:06,487 --> 01:04:09,487
 You will have to accompany me
 to the police station, madam.

771
01:04:09,667 --> 01:04:12,467
 Very well, monsieur.
 I will get my coat.

772
01:04:14,167 --> 01:04:18,167
 Any news, M. Snowshoe ?
 - Patience, patience.

773
01:04:19,227 --> 01:04:20,886
 The little ones are charming.
 - Very.

774
01:04:20,887 --> 01:04:23,387
 I want to manufacture
 a few false clues for them.

775
01:04:24,087 --> 01:04:26,087
 I don't understand.
 - I will leave a note, like..

776
01:04:26,127 --> 01:04:29,127
 ..''Martina, if you wish to live,
 stay away from the chateau.''

777
01:04:31,927 --> 01:04:33,086
 Why would you do that ?

778
01:04:33,187 --> 01:04:37,087
 The poor things, they ferret
 around and remain empty-handed.

779
01:04:38,067 --> 01:04:38,846
 A clue would..

780
01:04:38,847 --> 01:04:40,766
 ..place them in danger.

781
01:04:41,567 --> 01:04:44,567
 You do realise a murderer
 is perhaps in there ?

782
01:04:47,327 --> 01:04:51,327
 Monsieur, this is Huguette,
 one of Margaret Brown's dancers.

783
01:04:51,647 --> 01:04:54,566
 I have received a card from
 Anna.

784
01:04:54,567 --> 01:04:56,566
 Anna Karenine ?
 -*From Saint-Barth'.

785
01:04:57,267 --> 01:04:58,766
 When did she post it ?

786
01:04:58,867 --> 01:05:01,767
 The date-stamp... Wait...

787
01:05:01,927 --> 01:05:04,927
 14 or 17 December,
 it's not very clear.

788
01:05:06,247 --> 01:05:09,547
 17 December ?
 -*It was true about the Englishman.

789
01:05:12,047 --> 01:05:14,446
 Exit Anna Karenine.

790
01:05:14,547 --> 01:05:17,047
 A dancer has received a card
 from her in the West Indies.

791
01:05:18,327 --> 01:05:21,327
 So, we come back to
 Martina Charpentier.

792
01:05:21,687 --> 01:05:23,687
 The widow who didn't show up.

793
01:05:24,047 --> 01:05:27,406
 Everything points to the
 Charpentier children..

794
01:05:27,407 --> 01:05:30,186
 ..deciding not to split their
 inheritance..

795
01:05:30,187 --> 01:05:32,726
 ..with the new heir.

796
01:05:32,727 --> 01:05:36,727
 Let's find out which of them
 profits most from the crime.

797
01:05:37,327 --> 01:05:40,327
 As long as Old Man Charpentier
 lives, no-one will benefit.

798
01:05:42,607 --> 01:05:45,346
 I wonder if Dr. Lagarde 
 ever suspected..

799
01:05:45,547 --> 01:05:48,847
 ..that someone attempted to
 kill the old man ?

800
01:05:49,887 --> 01:05:52,387
 His symptoms were the same as
 poisoning with arsenic.

801
01:05:52,807 --> 01:05:55,207
 We know that a number of people
 would be interested in...

802
01:05:55,727 --> 01:05:57,686
 What shall we say...

803
01:05:57,687 --> 01:05:59,846
 Hastening his demise.

804
01:06:00,847 --> 01:06:03,847
 Mm... But the poisoner,
 after he had failed,..

805
01:06:04,047 --> 01:06:07,047
 ..would have increased the dose.
 But he didn't.

806
01:06:07,327 --> 01:06:10,327
 Yes, that doesn't make sense.
 Curious !

807
01:06:10,527 --> 01:06:15,527
 You've been their doctor,
 how long ?

808
01:06:16,567 --> 01:06:18,567
 M. Charpentier was my first
 patient after my arrival,..

809
01:06:18,967 --> 01:06:20,846
 ..following the death of my wife.

810
01:06:34,127 --> 01:06:35,886
 Is something wrong ?

811
01:06:36,287 --> 01:06:38,487
 I'm the only one without an
 alibi. That worries me.

812
01:06:39,047 --> 01:06:42,047
 Raphael was able to provide
 a detailed timetable.

813
01:06:43,487 --> 01:06:45,746
 Augustin was, of course,
 with a girl.

814
01:06:46,447 --> 01:06:47,866
 Why do you say ''of course'' ?

815
01:06:48,167 --> 01:06:50,567
 He is a womaniser,
 haven't you noticed ?

816
01:06:51,107 --> 01:06:54,807
 Beneath his air of being an
 artist, he has no feelings.

817
01:06:55,087 --> 01:06:59,087
 Apart from Emma, he doesn't like people.
 - What were you doing, that day ?

818
01:07:00,367 --> 01:07:03,766
 The passage of my days
 don't interest me any.

819
01:07:03,767 --> 01:07:05,846
 < What is there worth
 remembering ?

820
01:07:05,847 --> 01:07:08,526
 It seems to me you should
 try to remember.

821
01:07:09,527 --> 01:07:11,527
 I don't much like looking back.

822
01:07:20,207 --> 01:07:22,806
 It is good having you here.

823
01:07:23,407 --> 01:07:26,107
 You are cheerful, joyful.
 You are always singing.

824
01:07:26,807 --> 01:07:28,806
 Especially when I am cooking.

825
01:07:29,307 --> 01:07:31,126
 Meals are like plants.

826
01:07:31,427 --> 01:07:34,127
 They are better with a song.

827
01:07:35,267 --> 01:07:38,267
 For me, cooking is rather
 like jazz.

828
01:07:40,847 --> 01:07:44,847
 Beef on a string, where you
 mix raw and cooked meat,..

829
01:07:44,907 --> 01:07:48,646
 ..is rather like mouthing
 a trumpet.

830
01:07:48,767 --> 01:07:51,086
 The way it boils !

831
01:07:53,087 --> 01:07:55,787
 As for oysters,
 as the Martyr tells us,..

832
01:07:55,887 --> 01:07:59,487
 ..they are like the first
 Christians, eaten by lions,..

833
01:08:01,807 --> 01:08:03,166
 ..only a requiem will do !

834
01:08:04,167 --> 01:08:07,166
 You enliven the kitchen.
 You remind me of my wife.

835
01:08:07,267 --> 01:08:10,667
 She spread joy everywhere, and
 was not intimidated by my father.

836
01:08:12,547 --> 01:08:14,547
 In fact, she got on well
 with him.

837
01:08:16,047 --> 01:08:17,766
 But not you ?

838
01:08:17,767 --> 01:08:20,486
 He is obsessed with money.

839
01:08:20,487 --> 01:08:23,487
 He is sitting on a pile of gold
 without being able to touch it.

840
01:08:35,527 --> 01:08:37,527
 Name of God ! They even run
 between your feet.

841
01:08:40,927 --> 01:08:43,927
 Do you enjoy hunting ?
 - No, only killing.

842
01:08:45,327 --> 01:08:46,726
 You've been running.
 - Yes...

843
01:08:46,727 --> 01:08:48,727
 You have red cheeks,
 I like that a lot.

844
01:08:53,527 --> 01:08:56,527
 What ? Madam prefers
 older men, perhaps ?

845
01:08:57,407 --> 01:09:01,407
 Your younger brothers are
 not bad. Excuse me.

846
01:09:18,287 --> 01:09:20,887
 Colonel Snowshoe,
 we have found a clue.

847
01:09:23,847 --> 01:09:26,847
 It is proof that Martina
 was coming here.

848
01:09:26,927 --> 01:09:29,727
 That proves she was the woman
 in the sarcophagus, doesn't it ?

849
01:09:30,347 --> 01:09:32,766
 It's possible.
 Where did you find this ?

850
01:09:33,767 --> 01:09:35,767
 In the laundry room. We wore
 gloves, for the fingerprints.

851
01:09:36,727 --> 01:09:37,886
 You have done well.

852
01:09:38,487 --> 01:09:39,946
 Remember to relax your fingers.

853
01:09:40,087 --> 01:09:44,087
 You need to press the tip of
 your finger, but not so it hurts.

854
01:09:45,247 --> 01:09:47,006
 Monsieur Snowshoe...

855
01:09:50,087 --> 01:09:52,046
 Softly.

856
01:09:58,047 --> 01:10:01,047
 Without touching
 the other fingers.

857
01:10:06,047 --> 01:10:09,547
 I have come to see your sister,
 but first I have a question..

858
01:10:09,787 --> 01:10:12,606
 ..to ask madam.

859
01:10:12,608 --> 01:10:14,286
 I am in the way.

860
01:10:14,287 --> 01:10:17,287
 But we'll resume later.
 You have real potential.

861
01:10:22,267 --> 01:10:24,767
 Don't look so disapproving.

862
01:10:25,527 --> 01:10:28,927
 I have the right to learn the
 guitar, even with a nice man.

863
01:10:33,287 --> 01:10:35,887
 A masterpiece of forgery,
 I tip my hat to you !

864
01:10:36,447 --> 01:10:39,447
 But the situation is already
 complicated enough as it is.

865
01:10:40,287 --> 01:10:42,287
 I have never seen this envelope,
 where did you find it ?

866
01:10:44,207 --> 01:10:46,207
 You didn't write this ?
 - But, no.

867
01:10:48,447 --> 01:10:50,286
 I don't understand.

868
01:10:51,287 --> 01:10:52,766
 Do you recognise
 this envelope ?

869
01:10:52,767 --> 01:10:54,726
 Yes.
 It's the letter that I sent.

870
01:10:55,727 --> 01:10:56,846
 You have found Martina ?

871
01:10:57,847 --> 01:10:59,847
 This envelope was found here.

872
01:11:05,567 --> 01:11:08,567
 You think the woman in the
 sarcophagus really is.. Martina ?

873
01:11:10,887 --> 01:11:13,206
 It seems probable.

874
01:11:16,167 --> 01:11:18,867
 It looks as if you are
 leaving us.

875
01:11:19,007 --> 01:11:20,907
 Are your interrogations
 finished ?

876
01:11:21,087 --> 01:11:23,966
 Yes. For the moment.

877
01:11:37,127 --> 01:11:39,486
 He has found out something,
 that one.

878
01:11:39,487 --> 01:11:41,766
 What was he sniffing
 around for ?

879
01:11:42,367 --> 01:11:44,766
 Why tell him about Martina ?

880
01:11:45,767 --> 01:11:47,406
 Yes. Washing our dirty linen
 like that.

881
01:11:47,407 --> 01:11:49,326
 You should be thanking me,
 actually.

882
01:11:49,327 --> 01:11:50,566
 And why ?

883
01:11:50,567 --> 01:11:53,567
 The police would find it
 suspicious if no-one spoke..

884
01:11:53,607 --> 01:11:56,486
 ..now the dead woman seems
 really to be Martina.

885
01:11:57,187 --> 01:11:58,946
 What now ?

886
01:11:59,247 --> 01:12:01,247
 The installation is antiquated.

887
01:12:40,127 --> 01:12:42,627
 I would never have thought
 it of you.

888
01:12:45,087 --> 01:12:47,787
 You are trying to ruin me ?

889
01:12:49,247 --> 01:12:52,247
 Reassure yourself, M. Charpentier,
 it will cost you almost nothing.

890
01:12:53,007 --> 01:12:57,007
 What do you call ''nothing'' ?
 Name the price ! Name it !

891
01:13:02,247 --> 01:13:04,286
 Is that true ?!

892
01:13:05,947 --> 01:13:08,206
 You're not saying it just
 to soft-soap me ?

893
01:13:09,207 --> 01:13:11,766
 I swear it. On a cross of
 wood, a cross of iron.

894
01:13:13,367 --> 01:13:15,766
 Oh ! How did you do it ?

895
01:13:15,767 --> 01:13:17,926
 You are an angel, a pearl !

896
01:13:17,940 --> 01:13:18,940
 A fairy !
 - Oh !

897
01:13:19,500 --> 01:13:20,000
 Oh ! Please !

898
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:23,200
 You smell of good garlic !
 What a woman !

899
01:13:23,700 --> 01:13:27,500
 What a waist ! What hips !
 What a chest !

900
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:36,600
 Mme. Beresford,...

901
01:13:36,650 --> 01:13:38,900
 This evening,
 you will dine with us.

902
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:42,300
 It's gone again !

903
01:13:42,800 --> 01:13:45,500
 You will sit next to me.

904
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,500
 You do not look or act like a
 domestic, Mme. Beresford.

905
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,500
 Who are you ?
 Where do you come from ?

906
01:14:05,500 --> 01:14:07,600
 You discover a dead body
 on your arrival..

907
01:14:07,680 --> 01:14:09,700
 and the police hold us.

908
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,400
 < I have been watching
 you closely.

909
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:14,400
 And I will continue to do so.

910
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:21,500
 But what were you doing there ?

911
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:23,800
 I wanted to surprise you,
 and it went wrong.

912
01:15:24,487 --> 01:15:25,726
 Give me some light.

913
01:15:26,127 --> 01:15:28,127
 Yes. Wait a bit.

914
01:15:33,287 --> 01:15:35,287
 I didn't want to miss
 our Christmas tradition.

915
01:15:35,727 --> 01:15:37,326
 I have hurt you !

916
01:15:37,327 --> 01:15:39,186
 Where is it, the champagne ?
 Ah !

917
01:15:42,247 --> 01:15:44,447
 Colonel Beresford !
 Mm...

918
01:15:51,007 --> 01:15:53,606
 Some facts don't hold together.

919
01:15:54,407 --> 01:15:55,966
 What's that, Prudence ?

920
01:15:56,167 --> 01:15:59,167
 1, the envelope addressed to
 Martina was found here.

921
01:16:00,187 --> 01:16:02,487
 2, the Martina we found was
 about 20 years old.

922
01:16:03,767 --> 01:16:06,767
 And 3, the body has the
 feet of a dancer.

923
01:16:10,047 --> 01:16:12,647
 And our dancer is in the West
 Indies with her Englishman.

924
01:16:13,247 --> 01:16:15,847
 We were given a false clue,
 and we ran with it !

925
01:16:18,167 --> 01:16:19,886
 < Mademoiselle Prudence !

926
01:16:20,487 --> 01:16:22,887
 Yes, I'm coming, I'm coming !

927
01:16:30,927 --> 01:16:32,006
 Merry Christmas, my dear.

928
01:16:32,307 --> 01:16:34,307
 Give big hugs to the little
 ones for me.

929
01:16:35,327 --> 01:16:38,327
 Will you do me up ?

930
01:16:39,327 --> 01:16:41,727
 Thank you.
 How do I look ?

931
01:16:42,407 --> 01:16:47,407
 Now you can creep out as
 secretly as you came in.

932
01:17:01,267 --> 01:17:03,867
 The jewel suits you so well,
 my dear Mme. Beresford.

933
01:17:05,927 --> 01:17:07,966
 Dear Mme. Beresford.
 - Oh, not again !

934
01:17:14,687 --> 01:17:16,287
 It looks like Mother's brooch.

935
01:17:16,467 --> 01:17:17,806
 You're right, actually.

936
01:17:17,907 --> 01:17:19,786
 It does resemble it, yes.

937
01:17:19,987 --> 01:17:20,926
 I wonder !

938
01:17:21,527 --> 01:17:24,527
 Excuse me.

939
01:17:26,007 --> 01:17:29,007
 Excuse me. An urgent case,
 I must leave you.

940
01:17:31,687 --> 01:17:33,366
 A shame, I will accompany you.
 - Thank you.

941
01:17:34,367 --> 01:17:36,746
 This is good, the soup.

942
01:17:37,447 --> 01:17:40,447
 Ah, main course !
 The capon !...

943
01:17:43,407 --> 01:17:46,407
 Are your suitcases ready ?
 Not the pyjamas yet.

944
01:17:47,247 --> 01:17:49,246
 What time is your mother
 getting here tomorrow ?

945
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:50,700
 At ten o'clock.

946
01:17:51,407 --> 01:17:53,407
 <I'm so excited to be going
 skiing at Sils Maria !

947
01:17:55,127 --> 01:17:56,646
 < Oh, what a mess !

948
01:17:57,647 --> 01:17:59,326
 < I will miss you, Mme. Poppins.

949
01:18:00,327 --> 01:18:02,506
 < Will you go there for
 your holiday ?

950
01:18:11,447 --> 01:18:14,447
 What is wrong, Valerie ?
 - I don't know.

951
01:18:15,727 --> 01:18:18,406
 Where do you feel bad ?
 - In my stomach.

952
01:18:19,407 --> 01:18:20,907
 It doesn't feel right.

953
01:18:23,367 --> 01:18:24,767
 What is happening ?

954
01:18:25,407 --> 01:18:27,046
 Go and lay down.

955
01:18:29,047 --> 01:18:30,166
 What is this ?
 I will get help.

956
01:18:30,167 --> 01:18:31,126
 I am sick !

957
01:18:31,127 --> 01:18:34,127
 Lay down, I'll be back.

958
01:18:40,287 --> 01:18:41,286
 Mlle. Charpentier,..

959
01:18:41,288 --> 01:18:41,887
 ..the little ones are sick.

960
01:18:44,127 --> 01:18:45,727
 Are you not well ?
 No.

961
01:18:47,807 --> 01:18:48,766
 I... I'll be back.

962
01:19:17,887 --> 01:19:21,887
 They are all out of trouble.
 We must identify what happened.

963
01:19:22,647 --> 01:19:24,647
 You are the only one unaffected.
 Did you eat everything ?

964
01:19:24,687 --> 01:19:26,687
 Yes, apart from the Yule log,
 I've never liked it.

965
01:19:26,727 --> 01:19:29,727
 I didn't drink
 any of the champagne.

966
01:19:32,687 --> 01:19:34,406
 Is there anything left ?

967
01:19:34,407 --> 01:19:37,407
 No, they left nothing.
 They even sucked the bones.

968
01:19:39,007 --> 01:19:42,007
 Apart from the candied fruits
 and the carcase of the capon,..

969
01:19:43,327 --> 01:19:46,327
 ..there is nothing left.
 I also washed the dishes.

970
01:19:48,567 --> 01:19:52,567
 My God !
 Do you think it's arsenic ?

971
01:19:53,967 --> 01:19:55,966
 How do you know ?

972
01:19:55,967 --> 01:19:58,967
 Yes, there's a good chance
 that it is.

973
01:19:59,727 --> 01:20:03,727
 The killer may be among them,
 pretending to be sick.

974
01:20:04,767 --> 01:20:08,767
 Could you tell the difference
 between true sickness and fake ?

975
01:20:09,887 --> 01:20:12,086
 I don't think so, no.

976
01:20:15,407 --> 01:20:18,407
 I'll call for a nurse. She
 should be here by 8 o'clock.

977
01:20:19,447 --> 01:20:21,546
 I will prepare something for
 each of them.

978
01:20:21,547 --> 01:20:23,246
 I will be back
 to see how they are.

979
01:20:23,847 --> 01:20:25,446
 While I'm away,
 keep your eyes open.

980
01:20:26,447 --> 01:20:29,447
 Especially on Emma.
  - Yes, count on me.

981
01:20:34,647 --> 01:20:36,647
 I never thought I'd have to
 work on Christmas Day !

982
01:20:37,447 --> 01:20:39,566
 It's Mlle. Emma
 I feel sorry for.

983
01:20:40,567 --> 01:20:42,867
 I said to Mme. Beresford that
 the lobsters were worthless.

984
01:20:43,007 --> 01:20:46,007
 But she replied : ''No,
 the lobsters are very fresh.''

985
01:20:47,367 --> 01:20:51,367
 Who can say, with all the
 pollutants thrown in the sea.

986
01:20:53,567 --> 01:20:55,567
 In any case,
 I wouldn't eat them.

987
01:20:57,167 --> 01:20:59,167
 All of them
 could have been taken.

988
01:21:14,047 --> 01:21:16,047
 I am Mme. Valois,
 the mother of Valerie.

989
01:21:17,087 --> 01:21:18,726
 You've come to collect her ?

990
01:21:18,727 --> 01:21:21,727
 I wouldn't let your daughter
 come here any more.

991
01:21:21,747 --> 01:21:24,047
 Mme. Valois, I will take you
 to Valerie.

992
01:21:25,207 --> 01:21:28,007
 The house has suffered from
 a bout of food poisoning..

993
01:21:28,187 --> 01:21:29,246
 ..but Valerie is doing well.

994
01:21:31,247 --> 01:21:34,247
 Both she and Alexie are ready
 to leave. Follow me.

995
01:21:40,127 --> 01:21:41,406
 Ah ! My little girl !

996
01:21:42,407 --> 01:21:43,846
 What happened to you ?

997
01:21:46,607 --> 01:21:49,607
 I must tell you. Alexie's
 papa had a brother..

998
01:21:50,567 --> 01:21:53,567
 ..who is dead,
 and his wife...

999
01:22:00,527 --> 01:22:02,927
 Get Emma to send the nurse away,
 her charges will ruin me !

1000
01:22:03,087 --> 01:22:05,566
 That would mean I would have
 to take care of you myself.

1001
01:22:05,567 --> 01:22:08,406
 And I cannot be everywhere
 at the same time.

1002
01:22:09,407 --> 01:22:11,046
 Why can't Emma help you ?

1003
01:22:12,047 --> 01:22:13,506
 She is confined to her bed.

1004
01:22:13,407 --> 01:22:15,126
 And the others ?
 - The same.

1005
01:22:15,127 --> 01:22:19,127
 But they are all doing well.
 They are resting.

1006
01:22:20,047 --> 01:22:22,047
 What is that ?
 - Some bouillon and biscuits.

1007
01:22:22,127 --> 01:22:26,127
 Take it away. I want meat.

1008
01:22:27,047 --> 01:22:29,006
 The doctor has forbidden that
 for the moment.

1009
01:22:29,007 --> 01:22:32,007
 The doctor is an ass, I am well.
 Bring me meat !

1010
01:22:46,207 --> 01:22:47,646
 May I see Alexie's father ?

1011
01:22:48,647 --> 01:22:49,566
 Unfortunately,
 he is sick...

1012
01:22:49,567 --> 01:22:53,567
 My daughter told me about the
 woman in the sarcophagus.

1013
01:22:53,847 --> 01:22:55,846
 I have to speak to someone
 in the family.

1014
01:22:56,847 --> 01:22:58,366
 I will ask Mlle. Emma.

1015
01:22:59,367 --> 01:23:01,367
 Tell her that it's about
 Martina Petrovna.

1016
01:23:02,887 --> 01:23:04,166
 Martina Petrovna ?

1017
01:23:04,167 --> 01:23:07,167
 You have heard of Martina ?

1018
01:23:08,247 --> 01:23:11,247
 It's likely she is the woman
 found in the sarcophagus.

1019
01:23:12,487 --> 01:23:15,487
 That just isn't possible.
 - How so ?

1020
01:23:16,487 --> 01:23:18,487
 Because I am Martina Petrovna.

1021
01:23:27,727 --> 01:23:30,727
 I met Edmond in Damascus.

1022
01:23:34,127 --> 01:23:38,127
 We were together for a while,
 But then came the split-up.

1023
01:23:50,047 --> 01:23:52,047
 I was sent to Belgrade.

1024
01:23:53,167 --> 01:23:56,167
 There I met Valerie's father,
 who was posted down there.

1025
01:23:58,207 --> 01:23:59,207
 A Frenchman, like Edmond.

1026
01:24:04,767 --> 01:24:06,467
 You know...

1027
01:24:06,807 --> 01:24:09,007
 I have never forgotten your
 brother, and...

1028
01:24:12,007 --> 01:24:13,426
 When I learnt that,
 at boarding school,..

1029
01:24:13,427 --> 01:24:15,927
 ..my daughter had become
 friends with your niece,..

1030
01:24:18,387 --> 01:24:21,687
 ..you cannot know how much I
 was moved by this coincidence.

1031
01:24:23,247 --> 01:24:25,166
 I even thought of writing to you.

1032
01:24:26,167 --> 01:24:29,167
 And then, I said to myself,
 what good to stir up the past ?

1033
01:24:31,287 --> 01:24:33,787
 But when my daughter told me
 about the body found here,..

1034
01:24:33,847 --> 01:24:38,847
 ..I wanted to warn you.
 - Thank you so much.

1035
01:24:41,847 --> 01:24:43,126
 She is so charming.

1036
01:24:43,127 --> 01:24:45,206
 So, who was it wrote to me
 using her name ?

1037
01:24:46,207 --> 01:24:50,207
 Some crook, who then backed
 away from his deception.

1038
01:24:53,287 --> 01:24:54,826
 What is it,
 Mme. Beresford ?

1039
01:24:54,827 --> 01:24:57,046
 It is.. your brother, Augustin.

1040
01:24:57,047 --> 01:24:59,747
 What about Augustin ?
 I thought his condition...

1041
01:25:02,687 --> 01:25:04,446
 My brother is dead,..

1042
01:25:04,447 --> 01:25:06,366
 ..do I read you right ?

1043
01:25:07,367 --> 01:25:09,767
 I thought he was stronger.
 Clearly I was wrong.

1044
01:25:09,768 --> 01:25:11,886
 You don't seem very upset.

1045
01:25:11,887 --> 01:25:13,606
 Tears for the dead,
 no thank you !

1046
01:25:13,607 --> 01:25:17,607
 You are much too sentimental.
 You could become irksome.

1047
01:25:23,087 --> 01:25:26,087
 What's this I hear ?
 Augustin has breathed his last ?

1048
01:25:28,287 --> 01:25:30,126
 M. Charpentier,
 please return to your bed.

1049
01:25:30,127 --> 01:25:33,127
 No need,
 I have never felt better.

1050
01:25:33,207 --> 01:25:36,207
 So, is it true ?
 Is he really dead ?

1051
01:25:38,727 --> 01:25:40,646
 The one who was the most
 anxious to inherit.

1052
01:25:40,647 --> 01:25:42,846
 So much for the artist !
 One down, two to go !

1053
01:25:42,847 --> 01:25:44,886
 How can you say that ?

1054
01:25:44,887 --> 01:25:47,887
 Just you see,
 I will bury them all !

1055
01:25:48,487 --> 01:25:51,487
 Misfortune never comes alone.

1056
01:25:51,727 --> 01:25:53,727
 Now I can speak out, and
 tell you about these beauties !

1057
01:25:54,727 --> 01:25:58,727
 Do you want to hear ?
 - No.

1058
01:26:07,447 --> 01:26:09,447
 What is this ?
 Are you smoking, now ?

1059
01:26:12,487 --> 01:26:15,487
 These people, Belisaire,
 they are like wolves.

1060
01:26:18,527 --> 01:26:20,527
 No, not wolves,
 jackals.

1061
01:26:50,307 --> 01:26:52,686
 Sorry to hear of your brother.
 - Alright.

1062
01:26:52,687 --> 01:26:54,866
 Madame is home ?
 - She is waiting for you.

1063
01:26:55,847 --> 01:26:58,046
 < God !
 Camembert and everything ?

1064
01:27:00,247 --> 01:27:03,247
 Raphael,
 you look utterly dreadful !

1065
01:27:03,647 --> 01:27:06,606
 You... look resplendent.
 Been out amusing yourself ?

1066
01:27:06,607 --> 01:27:09,607
 Absolutely everyone is in 
 Mauritius now. God !

1067
01:27:09,707 --> 01:27:11,786
 But you've already spent
 a month there.

1068
01:27:11,787 --> 01:27:13,766
 Surely not ? A whole month ?
 - Yes.

1069
01:27:13,767 --> 01:27:15,767
 Oh well, as you say !
 God !

1070
01:27:27,727 --> 01:27:29,727
 And money is rather tight,
 for the present at least.

1071
01:27:35,127 --> 01:27:40,127
 In New York, I fell in with
 this crazy woman called Hermeline.

1072
01:27:40,927 --> 01:27:43,227
 She told the entire table that
 they had found..

1073
01:27:43,237 --> 01:27:46,247
 ..the body of a woman at
 Vallée-aux-Loups,...

1074
01:27:46,257 --> 01:27:49,206
 It was just so embarrassing.

1075
01:27:49,707 --> 01:27:51,926
 But it is true.

1076
01:27:51,927 --> 01:27:54,927
 Really!
 Who was she, this woman ?

1077
01:27:55,167 --> 01:27:57,146
 A woman from the East,
 apparently.

1078
01:27:58,047 --> 01:27:59,046
 A woman from the East !

1079
01:27:59,147 --> 01:28:02,047
 God !
 I don't feel so good.

1080
01:28:02,347 --> 01:28:04,246
 It won't keep me from my bed.

1081
01:28:05,647 --> 01:28:09,247
 Me too.
 I am completely jet-lagged.

1082
01:28:17,807 --> 01:28:20,086
 I almost forgot...

1083
01:28:20,087 --> 01:28:22,286
 This is for you.

1084
01:28:22,287 --> 01:28:24,646
 You have brought me back
 a gift ?

1085
01:28:24,647 --> 01:28:27,647
 No, it arrived this afternoon
 by Chronopost.

1086
01:28:31,847 --> 01:28:33,866
 ''Continue the treatment for
 three days.

1087
01:28:33,867 --> 01:28:35,846
 ''Two tablets in the evening
 before bed.''

1088
01:28:36,847 --> 01:28:40,547
 Lagarde told me to stop.
 - You must have misunderstood.

1089
01:28:41,807 --> 01:28:43,807
 In any case,
 it can't do you any harm.

1090
01:28:45,247 --> 01:28:47,247
 You're right,
 it can't do any harm.

1091
01:29:26,527 --> 01:29:29,527
 Raphael, God, I'm freezing !

1092
01:29:54,767 --> 01:29:57,286
 I suspected Augustin,
 and he is dead.

1093
01:29:58,287 --> 01:30:00,287
 I suspected Raphael,
 and he is dead.

1094
01:30:00,807 --> 01:30:03,407
 I dare not say I suspect
 Frederic, it might kill him.

1095
01:30:05,407 --> 01:30:07,407
 As for Emma...

1096
01:30:08,927 --> 01:30:12,806
 No, let's get back on the
 track of the dancer.

1097
01:30:12,807 --> 01:30:14,086
 From the start of this case,..

1098
01:30:14,087 --> 01:30:16,087
 ..we concentrated on
 Martina Charpentier,..

1099
01:30:17,407 --> 01:30:20,126
 ..because of the faked letter
 we were shown,..

1100
01:30:20,127 --> 01:30:22,766
 ..let's admit it,
 with heads bowed in shame.

1101
01:30:27,527 --> 01:30:30,527
 We must find the identity
 of this Anna Karenine.

1102
01:30:31,407 --> 01:30:33,407
 I believe that will lead us
 to the killer.

1103
01:30:34,567 --> 01:30:36,567
 The murder is linked to the
 Charpentier family..

1104
01:30:36,568 --> 01:30:40,247
 ..but not in the way
 we've considered so far.

1105
01:30:40,767 --> 01:30:42,526
 Don't you think so ?

1106
01:30:43,527 --> 01:30:45,206
 I understood nothing
 that you said.

1107
01:30:46,207 --> 01:30:47,766
 Ah well. Me, I have a plan.

1108
01:30:47,767 --> 01:30:50,767
 Yes sir, I have a plan.

1109
01:30:52,367 --> 01:30:53,706
 But I don't think I'll tell
 you what it is.

1110
01:30:57,567 --> 01:31:00,567
 Well, okay.
 It involves Aunt Babette.

1111
01:31:02,087 --> 01:31:04,006
 With Aunt Babette ?
 - Yes, with her.

1112
01:31:08,327 --> 01:31:10,606
 < This is the limit !

1113
01:31:10,607 --> 01:31:14,607
 First, you don't believe me,
 and take me for mad.

1114
01:31:14,687 --> 01:31:16,687
 Now, you ask me to do
 something embarrassing.

1115
01:31:16,688 --> 01:31:20,047
 Why should I go and take tea
 with strangers, and..

1116
01:31:20,067 --> 01:31:23,726
 ..then pretend to feel ill ?

1117
01:31:24,727 --> 01:31:25,706
 I tell you, I don't like it !

1118
01:31:25,707 --> 01:31:28,886
 I detest this sort of joke.

1119
01:31:28,887 --> 01:31:30,566
 This is not about comedy,
 but about murder.

1120
01:31:30,567 --> 01:31:35,527
 Prudence just asks you to
 follow her instructions.

1121
01:31:37,367 --> 01:31:39,367
 Aunt Babette !
 No !

1122
01:31:41,967 --> 01:31:47,967
 Well then, if I've understood
 her instructions,..

1123
01:31:47,977 --> 01:31:51,727
 ..I engage in a pleasant
 conversation with these toffs...

1124
01:32:00,647 --> 01:32:02,486
 And suddenly...

1125
01:32:02,487 --> 01:32:04,487
 Suddenly,
 I have a small problem.

1126
01:32:06,007 --> 01:32:09,007
 I use some pretext, er,
 I'll invent something,..

1127
01:32:09,087 --> 01:32:11,687
 ..in order to leave the room.

1128
01:32:13,847 --> 01:32:16,847
 And then ?
 - You return to the room.

1129
01:32:18,007 --> 01:32:20,007
 I return, when ?
 - At the signal.

1130
01:32:20,447 --> 01:32:23,447
 Ah, there'll be a signal ?
 - Mm...

1131
01:32:26,347 --> 01:32:28,647
 And I can show them
 my Zigoeunus ?

1132
01:32:32,047 --> 01:32:34,546
 ''Zigoeunus Thomasus moth,

1133
01:32:34,647 --> 01:32:38,447
 ''..North Sinnamary, French
 Guiana, 28 December 2007''

1134
01:32:39,087 --> 01:32:41,687
 It is a male.
 Beautiful, isn't he ?

1135
01:32:42,127 --> 01:32:44,727
 It is the highlight
 of my entire career.

1136
01:32:45,327 --> 01:32:47,546
 The male lives only
 for a few hours.

1137
01:32:47,647 --> 01:32:51,447
 Immediately after having
 ''met'' the female,..

1138
01:32:51,447 --> 01:32:52,826
 ..he dies.

1139
01:32:55,767 --> 01:32:58,767
 That is why he is so rare
 and difficult to capture.

1140
01:32:58,807 --> 01:33:02,807
 But there are several
 techniques : the picket line,..

1141
01:33:02,887 --> 01:33:04,886
 ..the zigzag chase.

1142
01:33:04,888 --> 01:33:06,566
 Keep it up.

1143
01:33:07,067 --> 01:33:10,567
 They are capricious creatures,
 sensitive to fragrances :..

1144
01:33:10,847 --> 01:33:13,446
 ..the patchouli,
 the honeysuckle...

1145
01:33:13,447 --> 01:33:15,486
 Chanel number 5...

1146
01:33:15,487 --> 01:33:18,487
 The most important thing for
 the catch is for the hunter..

1147
01:33:19,407 --> 01:33:22,407
 ..to conceal his shadow.

1148
01:33:23,527 --> 01:33:25,606
 But I am talking too much...

1149
01:33:25,607 --> 01:33:29,607
 And I'm not telling you what
 a wonderful home you have !

1150
01:33:30,707 --> 01:33:32,566
 Something for now.

1151
01:33:33,567 --> 01:33:36,567
 Oh, how delicious !
 Red mullet on toast.

1152
01:33:37,767 --> 01:33:39,726
 Quite a change to your diet
 in the Amazon !

1153
01:33:40,727 --> 01:33:42,246
 You might say so !

1154
01:33:42,247 --> 01:33:44,747
 But, that said, ants in pate
 are not so bad.

1155
01:33:47,567 --> 01:33:50,567
 They crack pleasantly
 on the tooth.

1156
01:33:51,727 --> 01:33:53,086
 And it's very economic.

1157
01:33:53,087 --> 01:33:54,246
 Do you have the recipe ?

1158
01:33:54,247 --> 01:33:55,646
 Now.

1159
01:33:56,647 --> 01:33:58,966
 Mm ! This is delicious.

1160
01:33:58,967 --> 01:34:01,067
 Would you like some fresh air ?
 - On the contrary.

1161
01:34:01,167 --> 01:34:03,846
 You look very pale !

1162
01:34:03,847 --> 01:34:07,647
 I am sorry. I must excuse
 myself for a few moments.

1163
01:34:08,267 --> 01:34:10,886
 Where is it ?

1164
01:34:10,887 --> 01:34:12,287
 Through there.

1165
01:34:23,207 --> 01:34:25,207
 Thank you, Francois,
 for coming.

1166
01:34:31,647 --> 01:34:33,686
 You look much better.
 You have got back..

1167
01:34:33,687 --> 01:34:35,966
 ..some of your colour.

1168
01:34:42,847 --> 01:34:44,726
 What is wrong here ?

1169
01:34:46,727 --> 01:34:48,727
 Stay calm.
 - Blockage in my throat !

1170
01:34:50,047 --> 01:34:53,047
 Let me take a look.
 Open your mouth.

1171
01:34:54,047 --> 01:34:56,726
 Calm yourself.
 Turn towards me.

1172
01:34:56,727 --> 01:34:58,366
 Tilt your head.

1173
01:35:02,967 --> 01:35:04,166
 It's him !

1174
01:35:04,167 --> 01:35:06,766
 The man on the train !

1175
01:35:07,687 --> 01:35:09,286
 No, no.
 Say nothing more.

1176
01:35:09,887 --> 01:35:10,886
 You didn't think..

1177
01:35:10,887 --> 01:35:13,387
 ..that a witness saw you
 strangle that woman.

1178
01:35:14,447 --> 01:35:17,447
 My aunt, Babette Boutiti,
 saw you.

1179
01:35:18,687 --> 01:35:20,446
 She was on the train..

1180
01:35:20,447 --> 01:35:22,126
 ..that ran beside your own.

1181
01:35:22,127 --> 01:35:24,686
 Suddenly, she saw...

1182
01:35:35,207 --> 01:35:37,006
 Mme. Beresford,
 I know you have been..

1183
01:35:37,007 --> 01:35:39,886
 ..overworked recently,
 but now,..

1184
01:35:39,887 --> 01:35:41,926
 ..you must be delirious.
 - No, not at all !

1185
01:35:42,927 --> 01:35:44,926
 Why would I strangle a woman
 unknown to me ?

1186
01:35:44,927 --> 01:35:47,406
 Unknown ?

1187
01:35:49,587 --> 01:35:51,587
 This woman, on the contrary,..

1188
01:35:51,588 --> 01:35:53,946
 ..you knew very well.

1189
01:35:54,447 --> 01:35:56,926
 She was your wife.

1190
01:36:11,287 --> 01:36:13,587
 He wanted to marry you,
 but he was already married..

1191
01:36:15,167 --> 01:36:17,667
 ..to Anna Stravinska, known 
 as Anna Karenine.

1192
01:36:18,327 --> 01:36:21,327
 A dancer
 who refused him a divorce.

1193
01:36:24,067 --> 01:36:26,086
 I thought he was a widower.

1194
01:36:26,187 --> 01:36:28,766
 And I thought
 you were a widow.

1195
01:36:28,768 --> 01:36:31,767
 Not a widow, not a domestic,
 not a cook.

1196
01:36:31,769 --> 01:36:33,126
 And this is my last service.

1197
01:36:34,127 --> 01:36:36,127
 Emma, you talked to him about
 Edmond ?

1198
01:36:38,287 --> 01:36:40,246
 And that was when
 he got an idea.

1199
01:36:41,247 --> 01:36:44,926
 He wrote to you a letter,
 and signed it ''Martina'',..

1200
01:36:44,927 --> 01:36:47,927
 ..killed his wife, and hid the
 body in the sarcophagus,..

1201
01:36:48,407 --> 01:36:51,246
 ..and, thanks to that letter,
 we were led astray,..

1202
01:36:51,247 --> 01:36:55,247
 ..and the body was identified
 as that of Martina.

1203
01:37:08,127 --> 01:37:10,127
 < And so, the family was
 implicated in the murder,..

1204
01:37:10,167 --> 01:37:14,167
 ..while he prepared for
 his next step.

1205
01:37:18,647 --> 01:37:20,947
 < He planned to kill all your
 brothers, and incriminate..

1206
01:37:20,948 --> 01:37:23,826
 ..the one who remained :..

1207
01:37:23,827 --> 01:37:25,826
 ..your father.

1208
01:37:25,927 --> 01:37:28,877
 So that you would be very rich
 by the time he married you.

1209
01:37:28,887 --> 01:37:31,887
 If it had been me who died on
 Christmas night, his plan..

1210
01:37:31,886 --> 01:37:34,127
 ..would have fallen apart.
 But I was too strong.

1211
01:37:34,247 --> 01:37:36,286
 He gave you a small dose
 of arsenic.

1212
01:37:36,287 --> 01:37:40,266
 Just enough to give you
 stomach pains.

1213
01:37:40,967 --> 01:37:43,806
 < The next day, the nurse,
 without knowing it,..

1214
01:37:43,807 --> 01:37:46,807
 ..gave Augustin the fatal
 dosage prepared by the doctor.

1215
01:37:48,808 --> 01:37:51,407
 Then it was only necessary
 to send Raphael his dosage..

1216
01:37:52,527 --> 01:37:53,806
 What a bastard !
 -< You should thank him !

1217
01:37:53,807 --> 01:37:55,086
 You owe him a debt of gratitude.

1218
01:37:55,087 --> 01:37:59,086
 All he brought me was trouble.

1219
01:37:59,087 --> 01:38:01,246
 A sarcophagus in pieces...

1220
01:38:01,247 --> 01:38:02,966
 And all the rest !

1221
01:38:02,967 --> 01:38:05,967
 You, your fortune has
 frankly doubled !

1222
01:38:14,367 --> 01:38:17,367
 They love their money,
 this family.

1223
01:38:33,207 --> 01:38:35,526
 I have avoided Christmas
 with the family !

1224
01:38:43,647 --> 01:38:45,726
 They are they still here.

1225
01:38:46,727 --> 01:38:48,846
 They said they were leaving !

1226
01:38:48,847 --> 01:38:50,847
 Perhaps they decided to stay
 for New Year's.

1227
01:38:57,327 --> 01:39:00,206
 Are there now ten of them ?

1228
01:39:00,207 --> 01:39:02,226
 No, just the two.

1229
01:39:07,287 --> 01:39:09,287
 And two can make this row ?

1230
01:39:09,407 --> 01:39:12,407
 Aunt Babette doesn't know
 how lucky she is.

1231
01:39:13,607 --> 01:39:15,607
 Nothing but butterflies,
 while living in a tent.

1232
01:39:15,617 --> 01:39:17,626
 Camping in the wild !

1233
01:39:45,007 --> 01:39:47,007
 I am parched !

1234
01:40:36,167 --> 01:40:38,167
 Belisaire, wake up.

1235
01:40:39,647 --> 01:40:41,886
 Open your eyes.

1236
01:40:42,887 --> 01:40:44,887
 And tell me what you see.

1237
01:40:46,607 --> 01:40:50,207
 Millions and millions
 of stars.

1238
01:40:51,007 --> 01:40:53,007
 And what do you make of them ?

1239
01:40:54,087 --> 01:40:56,087
 That there are millions
 of galaxies..

1240
01:40:56,687 --> 01:40:59,406
 ..and billions of planets.

1241
01:41:02,407 --> 01:41:05,407
 That Saturn is part of Leo.

1242
01:41:08,367 --> 01:41:11,367
 That the time is
 approximately..

1243
01:41:11,647 --> 01:41:13,286
 ..a quarter past three.

1244
01:41:15,287 --> 01:41:18,287
 That it should be a nice day
 tomorrow.

1245
01:41:21,887 --> 01:41:26,885
 I see that God is
 all-powerful..

1246
01:41:26,887 --> 01:41:29,887
 ..and that we are small and
 insignificant in the Universe.

1247
01:41:32,567 --> 01:41:34,567
 And you, Prudence,
 what do you see ?

1248
01:41:36,047 --> 01:41:39,747
 My poor Belisaire, I see
 you are a proper nitwit !

1249
01:41:40,087 --> 01:41:42,087
 Me,
 I see that we are finally free.

1250
